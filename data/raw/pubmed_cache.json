While their cardiometabolic benefits are well established, \nemerging observations suggest a potential association between GLP-1RA use and \nnew-onset nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).\nOBJECTIVE: To emulate a target trial evaluating the risk of NAION associated \nwith initiation of semaglutide (GLP-1RA), compared with a sodium-glucose \ncotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) as second-line therapy for T2D in a \nnationwide cohort of US veterans.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was conducted nationwide using \ndata from the Veterans Health Administration health care system between March 1, \n2018, and March 1, 2025. This active-comparator, new-user, target trial \nemulation used cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) that were estimated using \noverlap weighting to account for confounding. Participants included US veterans \nwith T2D, current metformin use, and no prior GLP-1RA or SGLT2i use. Data \nanalysis was conducted from July 2025 through September 2025.\nEXPOSURE: Initiation of semaglutide or any SGLT2i.\nMAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Incident NAION, identified using International \nStatistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth \nRevision and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine codes.\nRESULTS: A total of 102\u202f361 US veterans met inclusion criteria, including 11\u202f478 \ninitiators of semaglutide and 90\u202f883 initiators of an SGLT2i. Baseline \ncharacteristics were well balanced between treatment groups after overlap \nweighting (mean [SD] age, 60.1 [11.7] years; body mass index, 37.8 [6.7]; \nhemoglobin A1c, 7.0% [1.4]; 85.5% male and 14.5% female; 20.7% Black, 8.1% \nHispanic, and 61.9% non-Hispanic White). Over a maximum follow-up of 7.5 years, \n173 total incident NAION events occurred. The incidence rate of NAION was 123 \nper 100\u202f000 person-years among semaglutide initiators and 67 per 100\u202f000 \nperson-years among SGLT2i. In 2.1 years of median follow-up, semaglutide \ninitiators had a 2.33-fold higher risk than SGLT2i initiators (hazard ratio, \n2.33; 95% CI, 1.54-3.54; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The overlap weighted incidence rate of NAION \nwas 0.29% for semaglutide initiators and 0.13% for SGLT2i initiators, with a \ncorresponding average treatment effect of 0.16 percentage points.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this nationwide cohort of US veterans with T2D, \nsemaglutide initiators had a 2-fold NAION risk than SGLT2i initiators, while the \nabsolute risk was low. Clinicians and patients should be counseled on the rare \nbut evident increased risk of NAION after semaglutide initiation.\n\nDOI: 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2025.6262\nPMID: 41678180"

Care remains siloed and reactive despite shared risk \nfactors and strong evidence for early intervention. To support integrated \ndisease management, the American Heart Association (AHA) recently introduced the \nconcept of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, recognizing the \nbidirectional links between metabolic, kidney, and cardiovascular health. Kuwait \nfaces one of the highest burdens of CKM-related diseases globally. \nThree-quarters of adults are overweight or have obesity, and 28% have diabetes, \nboth of which are leading causes of mortality and health system strain. Yet \nmultidisciplinary care remains limited, and innovative pharmacotherapies, \nincluding glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), are underused. \nA panel of Kuwaiti endocrinologists, cardiologists, and nephrologists convened \nto assess barriers to optimal CKM care and define practical recommendations. \nDiscussions focused on current gaps in screening, care coordination, provider \neducation, and access to therapies. Evidence on GLP-1 RAs was reviewed, \nconsidering the demonstrated benefits for weight loss, glycemic control, \ncardiovascular outcomes, and CKD progression. The expert group agreed that \nmultidisciplinary, risk-stratified, and patient-centered approaches are urgently \nneeded. Recommendations include earlier screening and diagnosis, improved \nintegration across specialties, healthcare provider upskilling, public awareness \ncampaigns, and broader access to GLP-1 RAs. Semaglutide was highlighted as a \nclinically valuable option owing to its broad efficacy and safety profile. \nAdopting a CKM care model tailored to Kuwait's specific challenges, with \nappropriate use of GLP-1 RAs, can reduce disease burden, improve outcomes, and \nincrease healthcare system efficiency. The local implementation of \nevidence-based, cross-specialty strategies is key to altering the trajectory of \nCKM syndrome in high-risk populations.\n\n\u00a9 2026.

It can progress to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis \n(MASH) and fibrosis, cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. However, most \npatients with non-cirrhotic MASLD die from extrahepatic causes, particularly \ncardiovascular disease and non-hepatic cancers, underscoring the need for a \nholistic approach to surveillance and treatment. Emerging research on MASLD has \nrevealed a substantial heterogeneity in the MASLD population, driven by \nsex-specific factors, genetic susceptibility, cardiometabolic risk profile, \nlifestyle and socio-economic determinants, highlighting the necessity of \nindividualised and holistic management of MASLD patients. Although lifestyle \nintervention remains the cornerstone of MASLD, the pharmacotherapeutic landscape \nis rapidly evolving, with resmetirom and semaglutide now approved for \nnon-cirrhotic MASH with moderate-to-advanced fibrosis. In addition, \nmetabolic/bariatric surgery has proven to be a highly effective option for \npatients with MASH. Given its close association with cardiometabolic and \nmalignant comorbidities, MASLD requires individualised, holistic management \nintegrating hepatic and extrahepatic risks. Multiprofessional care, involving \namong others behavioural therapists, dieticians and physiotherapists, may \nimprove outcomes of lifestyle interventions, particularly in high-risk settings. \nA stepwise and integrated care model combining early case-finding, risk \nstratification, and tailored lifestyle and pharmacological interventions is \nessential to address both hepatic and extrahepatic complications. This review \nsummarises the current understanding of MASLD heterogeneity, clinical \nassessment, and therapeutic advances, and outlines principles for individualised \nand coordinated care.\n\nPlain Language Summary: Metabolic dysfunction\u2010associated steatotic liver disease \n(MASLD) is among the most common liver diseases worldwide, affecting over 30% of \nthe adult population. It is characterised by excessive lipid accumulation in the \nliver along with cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, \nabnormal serum glucose, abnormal serum lipids, or high blood pressure. If left \nuntreated, MASLD can progress to liver inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and \nliver cancer. Yet, most people with early MASLD do not die from liver\u2010related \nevents, but from cardiovascular diseases or cancers outside the liver, showing \nthat MASLD affects the whole body rather than just the liver. MASLD develops \ndifferently from person to person, and many factors (e.g., sex, genetics, \nlifestyle, socio\u2010economic conditions) play important roles as they impact on the \nliver, heart, kidney, and other organs. This means that healthcare in \nindividuals with MASLD should be holistic, considering liver disease and \nextrahepatic risk factors alike. A simple stepwise case\u2010finding algorithm helps \nto identify patients at risk in primary care, and appropriate risk \nstratification can pave the way for individualised management. Healthy lifestyle \nmodification remains the foundation of treatment. Weight loss, regular exercise, \nimproved diet, and objective assessment of alcohol intake are essential. New \nmedications such as resmetirom and semaglutide now offer options for patients \nwith advanced fibrosis. For some individuals with severe MASLD, bariatric \nsurgery can also be effective. This review provides guidance on early detection, \nrisk stratification, and personalised, holistic care to improve long\u2010term health \noutcomes in MASLD.\n\n\u00a9 2026 The Author(s).

The aim of \nthis study was to assess the risk of fragility fractures associated with \nglucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) therapy compared to \nsodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors \nin older adults with type 2 diabetes.\nMETHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective new-user cohort study \nusing the nationwide Clalit Health Services database. Participants included \npeople with type 2 diabetes aged 65 years or older who initiated GLP-1RA therapy \nor comparator drugs during 2018-2022. The primary outcome was first fragility \nfracture. Follow-up continued until fracture occurrence, death, or 31 March \n2024. An intention-to-treat approach was used. Baseline characteristics were \nbalanced using inverse probability of treatment weighting based on propensity \nscores. Hazard ratios were estimated using multivariate survival analysis \naccounting for the competing risk of death.\nRESULTS: The study included 46,177 participants: 11,257 GLP-1RA users and 34,920 \ncomparator drug users. During a median follow-up of 34.7 months, 4,086 (8.8%) \nindividuals experienced a fragility fracture and 4,595 (10.0%) died. In the \npropensity score-weighted model adjusted for baseline characteristics and \ncompeting risk of death new users of GLP-1RAs had an 11% increased fracture risk \ncompared to the comparator group (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.21).\nCONCLUSION: Initiating GLP-1RA therapy was associated with a modestly increased \nrisk of fragility fractures in older adults with type 2 diabetes. These findings \nmay inform clinical decisions by balancing clinical benefits against potential \nskeletal risks in this vulnerable population.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2026.

However, comparative evidence regarding cancer risk remains limited.\nMETHODS: We compared the risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and urothelial cell \ncarcinoma (UCC), two malignancies with rising incidence and poor prognosis, in \npatients with T2D initiating SGLT2i vs GLP-1 RA. A new-user comparative cohort \nstudy with a target trial emulation framework was conducted using the TriNetX \ndatabase from June 1, 2014, to May 31, 2024. We included adults with T2D who \ninitiated SGLT2i and those who initiated GLP-1 RA. Patients were matched 1:1 \nusing propensity scores based on age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, lifestyle \nfactors, medical utilization, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory \nmeasurements. Outcomes were incident RCC and UCC, analyzed with Kaplan-Meier \nplots and Cox regression.\nRESULTS: There were 294\u2009664 patients in each group after matching, with 278\u2009760 \nfemale individuals (47.3%), a mean age of 59.3 years, 377\u2009312 White individuals \n(64.0%), 117\u2009542 African American or Black individuals (20.0%), and 29\u2009750 Asian \nindividuals (5.1%). Over a mean follow-up of 44.2 months, SGLT2i use was \nassociated with a lower incidence of RCC (1.07\u00a0vs 1.26 per 1000 patient-years; \nhazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.92) and UCC \n(0.89\u00a0vs 1.05 per 1000 patient-years; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.92) than GLP-1 RA \nuse.

Among systemic biomarkers, \nhigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein remains the most widely used, although its \nlimited specificity underscores the need for more targeted inflammatory markers \nsuch as interleukin-6. Invasive intracoronary imaging with optical coherence \ntomography can visualize macrophage accumulation and quantify local inflammatory \nburden. Hybrid molecular imaging with OCT-NIRF, novel PET tracers and \nperi-coronary adipose tissue attenuation can provide emerging opportunities to \nfurther characterize vascular inflammation and residual risk. Anti-inflammatory \ntherapies represent a major opportunity to improve outcomes beyond lipid \nlowering. Among patients with coronary artery disease, the use of colchicine has \ndemonstrated significant risk reduction in adverse events, though with mixed \nresults. Important randomized trials are underway to investigate the efficacy of \nnovel monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin pathways. In addition, GLP-1 \nreceptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and PCSK9 inhibitors have been described to \nexhibit favourable vascular anti-inflammatory effects in experimental and \nin-vivo studies. In this comprehensive review, we provide an updated reappraisal \nof the available evidence unravelling how accurate identification of high-risk \npatients through multimodal imaging and biomarker profiling, combined with \nselective anti-inflammatory therapy, can represent a promising strategy for \nfurther reducing residual cardiovascular risk.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2026.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), such as \nsemaglutide, have shown cardiovascular benefits, but their impact on peripheral \nvascular outcomes remains unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the \neffect of semaglutide on limb events (LEs) in individuals with type 2 diabetes \nand/or overweight or obesity.\nMETHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, 19 randomized controlled trials \nencompassing 51,557 participants were included. Major limb events, prespecified \nand reported as safety outcomes in the original trials, were defined a priori as \nthe primary outcome of this meta-analysis, comprising revascularizations, \namputations, and PAD progression. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence \nintervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model.\nRESULTS: Semaglutide significantly reduced the risk of LEs compared to control \ninterventions (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.60-0.82; p < 0.0001), with no heterogeneity \nacross studies (I\u00b2 = 0%). Benefits were consistent across patient subgroups, in \npatients with diabetes (OR 0.70; 95% CI: 0.57-0.87; p = 0.001) or obesity (OR \n0.71; 95% CI: 0.56-0.89; p = 0.003); oral formulation (0.71; 95% CI: 0.53-0.94; \np = 0.02) or subcutaneous (0.68; 95% CI: 0.49-0.95; p = 0.02 and 0.71; 95% CI: \n0.57-0.89; p = 0.003, for 1.0 mg and 2.4 mg, respectively); and regardless of \nbackground SGLT2 inhibitor use. Meta-regression showed no significant effect \nmodification by age, BMI, HbA1c, follow-up duration, or SGLT2i use.\nCONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggest that semaglutide is associated with a \nsignificant reduction in major limb events across diverse populations and \ntreatment settings, supporting a potential protective effect on limb-related \nvascular safety.\n\nPlain Language Summary: This meta-analysis evaluates whether semaglutide can \nreduce the risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD) complications in people with \ndiabetes or obesity. By analyzing data from 19 randomized controlled trials \ninvolving over 51,000 participants, the findings highlight semaglutide\u2019s \npotential role in lowering the risk of amputations, revascularizations, and \ndisease progression, beyond its established benefits on weight loss and glicemic \ncontrol. Key findings:Semaglutide reduced the risk of PAD-related events by \nabout 30% compared with other treatments.The protective effect was consistent \nacross patient subgroups, formulations (oral or injectable), and irrespective of \nconcomitant SGLT2 inhibitor use.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2026.

However, the \nefficacy of GLP-1 RAs on the outcomes of MACEs across different racial and sex \ngroups among patients with and without T2DM remains underexplored. Thus, this \nstudy aimed to evaluate the association between GLP-1 RAs and MACEs in patients \nwith and without T2DM based on race and sex.\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search on the PubMed and Scopus \ndatabases, as well as ClinicalTrials.gov, for relevant randomized controlled \ntrials (RCTs) from inception to July 5, 2025. Trials were eligible for inclusion \nif the included adults (\u226518 years) had been randomized to a GLP-1 RA versus \nplacebo group, and MACEs were reported as an outcome. Trials combining GLP-1 RAs \nwith other investigational glucose-lowering agents were excluded. Risk ratios \n(RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effect \nmodel, and a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nRESULTS: Nine RCTs involving 81,266 patients were included in the analysis. The \nmean age of patients was 65 years. Compared with the placebo, GLP-1 RAs \nsignificantly reduced the risk of MACEs in males (RR, 0.82; 95% CI: 0.77-0.86; p \n< 0.001) and females (RR, 0.81; 95% CI: 0.75-0.88; p < 0.001). Meanwhile, across \nracial groups, GLP-1 RAs significantly reduced the risk of MACEs in Caucasian \npatients (RR, 0.87; 95% CI: 0.79-0.96; p < 0.001) compared with placebo. \nHowever, no significant difference was observed for the risk of MACEs in Black \npatients (RR, 1.05; 95% CI: 0.72-1.53; p = 0.80) when comparing GLP-1 RAs with \nplacebo.\nCONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates that GLP-1 RAs significantly reduce \nthe risk of MACEs in both males and females, as well as across various racial \ngroups in patients with or without T2DM. However, the lack of significant \nbenefit in Black patients suggests potential racial disparities in the \nenrollment and efficacy of GLP-1 RAs for cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2026 The Author(s).

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor \nagonist (GLP-1RA) are increasingly used in type 2 diabetic patients with kidney \ndisease, with recent evidence of both cardiovascular and renoprotective effects, \nyet their influence on AVF outcomes is unknown. The aim of this study was to \ninvestigate the impact of GLP-1RA on AVF outcomes in patients with ESKD.\nMETHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort study utilizing the \nTriNetX Research Network. This included 37,694 patients with ESKD who underwent \nopen AVF creation from January 2017 to October 2022, with a minimum of one year \nfollow-up. Patients started on new GLP-1RA therapy were matched 1:1 to \nnon-GLP-1RA controls using propensity scores accounting for patient \ndemographics, comorbidities, medication history, and diagnoses. Primary outcomes \nincluded the risk of fistula thrombosis, stenosis, infection, percutaneous \nangioplasty, and open revision over one year. Secondary outcomes included \ndialysis catheter intervention, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and \nall-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression and survival analyses \nwere performed.\nRESULTS: After matching, 1,239 well-matched pairs were created. Patients started \non GLP-1RA therapy were associated with a lower risk of fistula thrombosis (HR, \n0.77; 95% CI, 0.60-0.97; log-rank p=0.03), stenosis (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, \n0.71-0.95; log-rank p=0.01), infection (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41-0.90; log-rank \np=0.01), dialysis catheter intervention (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53-0.76; log-rank \np<0.01), and open revision (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.47-0.69; log-rank p<0.01) at one \nyear. No significant effects were observed for percutaneous angioplasty (HR, \n0.88; 95% CI, 0.75-1.05; log-rank p=0.15), MACE (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88-1.11; \nlog-rank p=0.86), or all-cause mortality (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.59-1.05; log-rank \np=0.10. The protective effects of GLP-1RA were more prominent among male \npatients and in those with HgbA1c \u22657%, BMI \u226535 kg/m2, or eGFR \u226430 mL/min/1.73 \nm2. These protective effects were also seen as early as twelve weeks after AVF \ncreation and persisted through three years, at which point GLP-1RA use was \nassociated with improved survival (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.96; log-rank \np=0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with ESKD undergoing AVF creation, new GLP-1RA therapy \nwas associated with reduced access complications, fewer dialysis catheter \nintervention, and improved long-term survival. These findings suggest that \nGLP-1RA use may promote a favorable environment following access creation, \nallowing AVF to mature.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2026.

However, their development has been challenged by deleterious \ncardiovascular (CV) effects including increased heart rate (HR), elongated QTc, \nand arrhythmia mediated by GcgR agonism. GLP-1R mono-agonists on the other hand \nimprove both obesity and CV outcomes with negligible effects on EE. We sought to \nimbue peptide GLP-1R agonists with an EE enhancing effect by combining them with \nectopic GLP-1R expression and agonism in hepatocytes.\nMETHODS: We used an adeno-associated virus (AAV) to induce the expression of a \nfunctional, liver-specific GLP-1R combined with traditional peptide agonist \ntreatment to drive greater body weight loss via reduced energy intake and \nincreased energy expenditure.\nRESULTS: Agonism of the ectopic GLP-1R with either semaglutide, a cAMP biased \nGLP-1R analogue (NNC5840), or a dual GLP-1R/GIPR agonist in wild-type (WT) diet \ninduced obese (DIO) mice led to enhanced EE and improved weight loss compared to \npeptide agonist treatment alone.\nCONCLUSIONS: This represents a novel mechanism for achieving poly-pharmacology \nto treat obesity.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 The Author(s).

The parallel \nrise in obesity has exacerbated this burden, with projections suggesting over \nhalf of the adult population will be overweight or obese by 2050. Incretin-based \ntherapies have emerged as cornerstone treatments for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), \noffering glycemic control alongside promising cardiovascular and renal benefits.\nRESULTS: This review consolidates current evidence regarding the cardiovascular \neffects of incretin-based medications. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have \ndemonstrated protective effects in preclinical models. Clinical trials show \nmodest but consistent reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), \nwith additional renal benefits. Conversely, DPP-4 inhibitors display \ncardiovascular neutrality. Real-world studies largely support the superiority of \nGLP-1RAs over other glucose-lowering agents (e.g. DPP-4 inhibitors, insulin) in \nreducing MACE, though their benefits in heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection \nfraction remain limited. Recent trials in patients with obesity-related HFpEF \ndemonstrate that GLP-1RAs and dual GIP/GLP-1 agonists significantly improve \nsymptoms, functional status, and reduce HF events.\nCONCLUSIONS: While incretin therapies represent a transformative advancement in \ncardiometabolic care, challenges remain-including gastrointestinal side effects, \nadherence issues, lean mass loss and cost.

However, evidence comparing the long-term \ncardiovascular benefits of GLP-1RAs versus MBS remains limited. We \nsystematically compare the impact of GLP-1RAs versus MBS on cardiovascular \noutcomes, including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and heart \nfailure (HF) in patients with obesity.\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA \n2020 guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase were searched up to \nJuly 30, 2025, for studies comparing cardiovascular outcomes of GLP-1RAs and \nMBS. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies reporting cardiovascular disease \n(CVD), including MACE and HF. Risk of bias was assessed using the \nNewcastle-Ottawa Scale. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed using the R \nmeta package. Heterogeneity was evaluated with I\u00b2 statistics, and publication \nbias was assessed via funnel plots and Egger's test.\nRESULTS: Six cohort studies, including over 282,450 participants, compared \ncardiovascular outcomes of MBS versus GLP-1RAs. MBS was associated with a \nsignificantly lower prevalence of CVD (RR\u2009=\u20090.63; 95% CI: 0.49-0.81; I\u00b2 = 87.7%) \nand HF (RR\u2009=\u20090.50; 95% CI: 0.37-0.66; I\u00b2 = 70.2%) compared to GLP-1RAs. For \ncerebrovascular events, a non-significant trend favored MBS (RR\u2009=\u20090.68; 95% CI: \n0.34-1.36; I\u00b2 = 91%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these \nfindings, and no significant publication bias was detected.\nCONCLUSIONS: Compared to GLP-1RAs, metabolic bariatric surgery is linked to \nbetter cardiovascular outcomes and a decreased prevalence of heart failure in \nindividuals with obesity. Although trends point to possible cerebrovascular \nbenefits, there is insufficient research to draw firm conclusions. These \nfindings might help physicians tailor their approaches to managing obesity in \norder to maximize the reduction of cardiovascular prevalence.\n\n\u00a9 2026.

However, their effects on lean mass in older adults are unclear. This \ncase report describes how GLP-1 RAs influenced body composition in 2 older \nwomen.\nCASE REPORT: We measured the body compositions of 2 older women with obesity, \nwho were unable to lose weight through lifestyle changes alone, before and after \ntaking GLP-1 RAs. The first patient (65 years old) received weekly subcutaneous \ninjections of tirzepatide. She had a moderate reduction in body mass index over \n4 months, with a modest reduction in fat mass and a substantial reduction in \nlean mass. The second patient (79 years old) received weekly subcutaneous \ninjections of semaglutide and had a moderate reduction in body mass index over 6 \nmonths, with a substantial reduction in fat mass and a modest gain in lean mass. \nThe patient with greater muscle loss was less physically active and tracked food \nintake less precisely than the patient with less muscle loss.\nDISCUSSION: Differences in lean mass loss between patients may be influenced by \nexercise and calorie counting. These findings highlight the importance of \nlifestyle modifications for preserving lean mass. However, because only 2 \npatients were studied, the results are entirely anecdotal and therefore cannot \nbe generalized to larger populations.\nCONCLUSION: Clinicians should consider recommending individualized exercise \nprograms and dietary strategies for older patients taking GLP-1 RAs.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and \nsodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which were originally \ndeveloped for treatment of T2DM and/or obesity, have recently been shown to \nreduce exacerbations in observational studies of patients with COPD, suggesting \nthat repurposing GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors could improve clinical outcomes \nin COPD.\nAREAS COVERED: COPD, diabetes, and obesity share several common inflammatory \npathways, including macrophage dysfunction, inflammasome activation, and \nmetabolic dysregulation. Here we review the pharmacology, pre-clinical, and \nemerging clinical data which could support repurposing of GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 \ninhibitors for use in COPD through a search of articles in PubMed and Medline \nfrom 01/1950 to 08/2025.\nEXPERT OPINION: Reevaluating metabolic therapeutic targets has the potential to \nredefine treatment strategies for patients with COPD and metabolic \ncomorbidities. Potential mechanisms of action could be via modulation of the \nNLRP3 inflammasome and macrophage polarization or better control of co-morbid \nconditions. However, randomized controlled trials and mechanistic studies are \nneeded to confirm these observational findings and elucidate underlying \nmechanisms.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/1744666X.2026.2625967\nPMID: 41640042"

Evidence regarding the \nimpact of different glucose-lowering medications on these outcomes remains \ninconclusive.\nMETHODS: We emulated a target trial using two linked national claims databases \n(OptumLabs Data Warehouse, Medicare fee-for-service). We included adults with \nT2D at moderate cardiovascular risk who initiated GLP-1RA, SGLT2i, DPP-4i, or \nsulfonylurea between 2014-2021, and used propensity score inverse probability of \ntreatment weighted Cox proportional hazards models to compare the incidence \nrates of the primary composite outcome of incident foot ulcer/abscess, \nosteomyelitis, Charcot arthropathy, or amputation across the four medication \nclasses under the intention-to-treat framework.\nRESULTS: The weighted study cohort included 81,998 DPP4i-initiators, 43,734 \nGLP-1RA-initiators, 57,399 SGLT2i-initiators, and 206,374 \nsulfonylurea-initiators; they were well balanced on all examined baseline \ncharacteristics. Sulfonylurea use was associated with a higher risk of the \ncomposite lower extremity complications outcome compared to DPP-4i (HR 1.15; \n95%CI 1.11-1.19), GLP-1RA (HR 1.20; 95%CI 1.13-1.28), and SGLT2i (HR 1.08; 95%CI \n1.02-1.14). SGLT2i use was also associated with a higher risk compared to \nGLP-1RA (HR 1.11; 95%CI 1.03-1.21). Amputation events were rare in all treatment \ngroups.\nCONCLUSION: We observed greater relative risk of lower extremity complications \nwith sulfonylurea use compared to DPP4i, GLP-1RA, and SGLT2i use, and with \nSGLT2i use compared to GLP-1RA use. Reassuringly, the absolute differences \nbetween the medication classes were <1%.

A GLP1R natural \nmissense variant, A316T, protects against T2D and cardiovascular disease. Here, \nwe generated and characterized a human GLP1R A316T mouse model. Human \nGLP1RA316T/A316T mice displayed lower fasting blood glucose versus wild-type \nlittermates even under metabolic stress, as well as slower weight gain and \nalterations in islet cytoarchitecture, glucagon secretion, and liver metabolism \nunder a high-fat, high-sucrose diet.

These conditions cluster in patients with heart failure and \ncardiomyopathies, limiting therapeutic options. Although cardiomyopathies \ncontribute substantially to the burden of heart failure, the impact of metabolic \ndisorders on their progression remains underexplored. This review explores the \ncomplex cardiorenal and metabolic dimensions of cardiomyopathies, focusing on \npathophysiological mechanisms, therapeutic innovations, and future \norganizational models.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Metabolic disorders likely modulate genotype-phenotype \nexpression, aggravate myocardial dysfunction, and accelerate disease progression \nthrough converging molecular mechanisms and pathways leading to energetic \nimbalance, inflammation and fibrosis. Novel therapies act on these pathways \nfavouring microscopic and macroscopic reverse remodelling. A holistic and \nmultidisciplinary approach is required to select appropriate therapies, improve \ndisease progression and quality of life of these patients. Cardiomyopathies \nexemplify the complexity of heart failure, where genetic and metabolic \ndysfunctions coexist and act as both triggers and amplifiers of myocardial \ndamage. DCM, HCM, HCM phenocopies and ARVC all present the burden of metabolic \ndisorders and some of them benefit from novel therapies. SGLT2i, GLP1-RA, and \nnon-steroidal MRA represent the forefront of a new therapeutic era, aiming at \npleiotropic targets beyond neurohormonal blockade. Integrated care models will \nreshape disease management and improve patients' outcomes. Future research \nshould investigate on metabolic disorders prevalence in cardiomyopathies and \nbetter characterize molecular pathways and phenotypic profiles that mostly \nbenefit from novel therapies.\n\n\u00a9 2026.

The purpose of this review is to evaluate and compare obesity \nmanagement strategies, with a focus on the magnitude of weight loss achieved and \nthe adverse effects associated with each intervention. This review was conducted \nin accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and \nMeta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to ensure methodological rigor in study \nselection and reporting. Bariatric surgery is currently considered the most \neffective intervention for achieving significant and sustained weight reduction, \nparticularly in patients with severe obesity. Procedures such as Roux-en-Y \ngastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and adjustable gastric banding \nconsistently demonstrate superior weight loss and metabolic improvements \ncompared with nonsurgical therapies. However, surgery carries well-documented \nrisks, such as gastric strictures, anastomotic leaks, thromboembolic events, \ninfections, and the need for reoperations. Long-term challenges include \nnutritional deficiencies, GI complications, and, in some patients, partial \nweight regain. Pharmacologic options are increasingly important adjuncts or \nalternatives to surgery. Novel agents, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor \nagonists (GLP-1RAs), have gained popularity due to their substantial efficacy \namong pharmacological options, favorable safety profile, and non-invasive \nnature. Other agents, including phentermine-topiramate (PHEN-TPM), \nnaltrexone-bupropion, and orlistat, also play roles in individualized treatment \nplans, although weight loss outcomes are typically more modest than with \nsurgical approaches. In conclusion, a multimodal strategy integrating surgical \nand medical therapy may provide the most durable results. This approach not only \nenhances weight loss but also supports long-term maintenance and optimizes \nmanagement of obesity-related comorbidities.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2026, Steven et al.\n\nDOI: 10.7759/cureus.100704\nPMCID: PMC12863638\nPMID: 41635371\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflicts of interest: In compliance with the \nICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following: \nPayment/services info: All authors have declared that no financial support was \nreceived from any organization for the submitted work.

Although glucagon-like \npeptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) improve glycemic control and \ncardiovascular outcomes, the mechanisms linking GLP-1RA therapy, gut microbiome \nmodulation, and endothelial function remain incompletely understood. In this \nstudy, we investigated whether the GLP-1RA liraglutide improves endothelial \ndysfunction in T2DM through microbiome-associated mechanisms that support \nvascular homeostasis. Male db/db mice and non-diabetic controls were treated \nwith liraglutide (300\u202f\u03bcg/kg/day, intraperitoneally) or saline for two weeks. \nVascular function was assessed in mesenteric resistance arteries using wire \nmyography. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to high \nglucose with or without liraglutide or the short chain fatty acid (SCFA), \nbutyrate. Endothelial nitric oxide (NO) signaling was evaluated by eNOS (at \nSer1177) phosphorylation and nitrite production. Gut microbiota composition was \nanalyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Liraglutide significantly improved \nendothelium-dependent relaxation in db/db mice and restored high glucose-induced \nimpairment of eNOS phosphorylation and NO production in HUVECs. In vivo, \ndiabetes was associated with marked gut dysbiosis characterized by reduced alpha \ndiversity and depletion of SCFA-producing taxa. Liraglutide treatment \nsubstantially restored microbial diversity and enriched beneficial genera, \nincluding Lachnospiraceae and Lactobacillus. Consistently, low-dose butyrate \nmodestly enhanced NO production in endothelial cells. These findings support the \nconcept of a GLP-1RA-microbiome-vascular axis, in which liraglutide-associated \nremodeling of the gut microbiota may contribute to improved endothelial NO \nsignaling and vascular function in diabetes.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 The Authors.

ALD and MASLD have become the first and second \nleading indications for LT (41% and 12% in Europe, respectively), with MetALD \naccounting for a rapidly increasing proportion of transplants (8-10%). Candidate \nevaluation must be multidisciplinary and account for the complex interplay \nbetween alcohol use, metabolic syndrome, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and \nobesity. Early LT for severe alcohol-related hepatitis is an established option \nin selected patients after the evaluation of alcohol use disorder (AUD) by \naddiction specialists. While the duration of abstinence remains a predictor of \npost-LT alcohol relapse in ALD recipients, an integrative assessment is \nrequired, and prolonged abstinence is no longer an absolute prerequisite. \nCardiovascular risk stratification and assessment of frailty and metabolic \ncomorbidities are essential. Obesity management includes lifestyle \ninterventions, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery in selected cases. SLD \nrecipients generally demonstrate good 5-year survival (>75%), but long-term \noutcomes are influenced by cardiovascular events, malignancies, and alcohol \nrelapse, with survival falling below 65% at 10 years. Early detection and \nmanagement of alcohol relapse after LT are critical to optimising long-term \noutcomes. MASLD recurrence is common, but its impact on graft survival appears \nmodest.

This increases systemic \ninflammation, cardiovascular risk, and disease severity while reducing the \nefficacy of biologic treatments. Despite this overlap, dermatology lacks \nobesity-specific guidance. This review evaluates lifestyle, pharmacological \n(glucagon-like peptide\u00a01 receptor agonists [GLP-1 RAs] and tirzepatide) and \nsurgical strategies, as well as clinic-level algorithms, to inform \ndermatological practice.\nMETHODS: We performed a narrative synthesis of epidemiology, randomized trials, \nreal-world studies, and guideline recommendations. Our focus was on the \npathophysiology and the efficacy of GLP-1 RAs and tirzepatide, providing a \npractical algorithm pathway for triage, pharmacotherapy escalation, and referral \ncriteria to a multidisciplinary unit.\nRESULTS: Although there are no psoriasis-specific guidelines for obesity \ntreatment, the strong link between the two conditions and the poorer therapeutic \nresponse observed in obese patients make addressing excess weight essential for \npeople with psoriasis. The proposed algorithms emphasize universal lifestyle \ncounseling and dermatology-led management for patients with a BMI (body mass \nindex)\u2009<\u200935\u00a0kg/m2 and without major metabolic complications. GLP-1 RAs are \nconsidered the first-line treatment, given the available scientific evidence \nabout their efficacy in terms of weight loss and management of comorbidities, as \nwell as their safety profile. If weight loss with these drugs is insufficient, \nthe next proposed treatment step is tirzepatide. Bariatric surgery, including \nbypass procedures, should be reserved for patients with a BMI\u2009\u2265\u200940\u00a0kg/m2, or \nwith a BMI\u2009\u2265\u200935\u00a0kg/m2 when earlier measures have failed and/or comorbidities are \nnot adequately controlled.\nCONCLUSION: Dermatologists should integrate obesity assessment and \npatient-centered interventions into psoriasis care.

However, there are concerns about an \nincreased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) associated with the use of SGLT2i, \nparticularly in patients with CKD.\nMETHODS: The is a population-based, new-user, active comparator cohort study \ncomparing SGLT2i vs. GLP1RA initiators using three U.S. healthcare databases: \nOptum's de-identified Clinformatics\u00ae Data Mart (2014-2024), Merative MarketScan \n(2014-2022), and Medicare Fee-for-Service (2014-2020). The exposure is \ninitiation of either SGLT2i or GLP1RA, defined as a new prescription without \nprior use in 365 days. The primary outcome was hospitalization with DKA \nidentified via inpatient ICD-9/10 codes. Incidence rates (IRs), rate differences \n(RDs), and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated.\nRESULTS: After 1:1 propensity score matching, the study population included \n143,858 patients, 71,929 in the SGLT2i arm and 71,929 in the GLP1RA arm. The \nmean age (standard deviation) was 71.28 (8.16) years, and 48.8% were female. \nPatients initiating SGLT2i had higher risk of hospitalization with DKA compared \nto GLP1RA initiators (IR 4.37 vs. 3.13 events per 1,000 person-years; RD 1.23 \n[95% CI 0.54, 1.92]; HR 1.40 [95% CI 1.16, 1.68]). The number needed to harm was \n813 per 1,000 person-years for SGLT2i compared to GLP1RA initiation. Results \nremained consistent in subgroup analyses stratified by age (<70 vs. \u226570 years), \nsex, body mass index (<30 vs. \u226530 kg/m2), frailty status, baseline \ncardiovascular disease, diabetic retinopathy, hyperglycemia, metformin use, and \ninsulin use.\nCONCLUSIONS: The incidence rate of DKA among SGLT2i and GLP1RA initiators \nremained low overall.

Glucagon-like \npeptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) demonstrate cardioprotective benefits \nthat may extend beyond glycemic control, but their effects on key inflammatory \nand oxidative stress biomarkers compared to other glucose-lowering medications \nremain inconsistently reported across individual studies.\nMETHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials \n(RCTs) was conducted. Databases were searched for RCTs comparing GLP-1 RAs \nagainst other antidiabetic drugs or placebo in adults with T2D, reporting \nchanges in inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin-6 \n[IL-6], tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-\u03b1]) or the oxidative stress marker \nmalondialdehyde (MDA). Data were pooled using a random-effects model, and \noutcomes were stratified by comparator type (placebo, insulin, other oral \nantidiabetic drugs [OADs]).\nRESULTS: Forty RCTs (n=6029 participants) were included. GLP-1 RA therapy \nsignificantly reduced CRP levels compared to placebo (SMD = -0.59; 95% CI: -0.84 \nto -0.34) and other OADs (SMD = -1.06; 95% CI: -1.64 to -0.47). A significant \nreduction in TNF-\u03b1 was observed versus placebo (SMD = -0.61; 95% CI: -0.89 to \n-0.32) and oral antidiabetic drugs add on (SMD = -1.62; 95% CI: -2.86 to -0.38). \nData for MDA were limited and showed a non-significant trend toward reduction. \nGLP-1 RAs also significantly reduced IL-6 versus insulin (SMD = -0.24; 95% CI: \n-0.46 to -0.02). While significant heterogeneity was noted across the analyses, \nsensitivity analyses confirmed a consistent direction of effect, reinforcing the \nclass-wide anti-inflammatory properties of GLP-1 RAs.\nCONCLUSION: GLP-1 RAs significantly improve key biomarkers of systemic \ninflammation (CRP, TNF-\u03b1) in patients with T2D compared to various active \ncomparators and placebo. These pleiotropic effects provide a mechanistic \nrationale for their cardiovascular benefits and support their use as a \nmultifaceted therapeutic strategy in T2D management.\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: \nhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251157476, identifier \nCRD420251157476.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 Alrasheed, Mostafa, Madkhali and Khairy.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fendo.2025.1734549\nPMCID: PMC12852008\nPMID: 41625236 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The author(s) declared that this work was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."

Rising obesity prevalence has \nled to a parallel increase in hypertension, driven by complex physiological \ndisturbances that extend beyond excess body weight alone. This review \nsynthesizes current evidence on the mechanisms linking adiposity to blood \npressure elevation, emphasizing the roles of sympathetic nervous system \noveractivity, insulin resistance, renal sodium retention, and adipose-derived \nhormonal and inflammatory dysregulation. Particular attention is given to \nvisceral adiposity, which exerts adverse vascular, renal, and metabolic effects \nthat accelerate development of hypertension-mediated organ damage, including \nleft ventricular hypertrophy, arterial stiffness, and early renal injury. The \nmanuscript also evaluates therapeutic strategies for obesity-related \nhypertension. Lifestyle interventions-caloric restriction, structured physical \nactivity, and behavioral therapy-remain the cornerstone of management, producing \nclinically meaningful reductions in body weight and blood pressure. However, \nsustained weight loss is difficult for many individuals, necessitating \nadjunctive approaches. Contemporary pharmacotherapies, particularly \nglucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide, have demonstrated \nsubstantial benefits in both weight reduction and blood pressure control. For \npatients with severe obesity or inadequate response to medical therapy, \nmetabolic and bariatric procedures offer the most durable outcomes, improving \ncardiometabolic profiles and reducing antihypertensive medication burden.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Evidence \nfrom clinical trials has demonstrated that intensive glycemic control alone \nprovides limited protection against macrovascular outcomes, underscoring the \nneed for comprehensive secondary prevention strategies.\nOBJECTIVES: This review aims to synthesize recent advances in integrated \nsecondary prevention strategies for macrovascular complications in T2DM, with \nemphasis on pharmacological, lifestyle and personalized approaches that extend \nbeyond glucose lowering.\nMETHODS: A narrative review of the literature published between 2015 and 2025 \nwas conducted, including randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, major \ncardiovascular outcome trials and international guideline updates. Evidence was \nevaluated across key domains: Glycemic management, lipid lowering, blood \npressure control, antithrombotic therapy, lifestyle interventions, emerging \npharmacotherapies, biomarkers and digital health-based risk stratification \ntools.\nRESULTS: Accumulating evidence supports a multifactorial approach to secondary \nprevention in T2DM. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like \npeptide-1 receptor agonists consistently reduce major adverse cardiovascular \nevents, heart failure hospitalization and renal outcomes, independent of \nglycemic control. Optimized lipid management with statins, PCSK9 inhibitors and \nicosapent ethyl, along with strict blood pressure control and selective \nantiplatelet therapy, further lowers atherosclerotic risk. Emerging strategies \ntargeting inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and the gut microbiota show \npromise. Biomarkers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, N-terminal \npro-brain natriuretic peptide and cystatin C, combined with artificial \nintelligence-driven risk prediction models, enable improved patient \nstratification and individualized therapy.\nCONCLUSION: Secondary prevention of macrovascular complications in T2DM requires \nan integrated, multidisciplinary strategy combining cardioprotective \npharmacotherapy, lifestyle modification and personalized risk assessment. \nAdvances in novel therapies, biomarkers and digital health technologies offer \nsubstantial potential to further improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes in \nthis high-risk population.\n\nDOI: 10.36721/PJPS.2026.39.3.REG.15014.1\nPMID: 41620898 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor \nagonists (GLP-1 RAs) reduce cardiovascular risk and exhibit neuroprotective \nproperties, yet their effects in incident VaD remain uncertain. This study \nevaluated whether GLP-1 RAs have preventive potential for VaD in adults with \nT2DM, overweight, or obesity.\nMETHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled clinical \ntrials (RCTs) was conducted to estimate the risk of incident VaD among patients \nwith T2DM or overweight/obesity treated with GLP-1 RAs versus placebo. Data were \npooled using a random-effects model, with outcomes expressed as risk ratios \n(RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analysis was performed after \nstratification by population type (T2DM vs. overweight/obesity), and \nmeta-regression assessed the association between RCT duration and effect size.\nRESULTS: Seven RCTs (six in T2DM, one in overweight/obesity) comprising 61,610 \nparticipants were included. GLP-1 RA treatment was not associated with a \nstatistically significant difference in VaD incidence (RR: 0.50; 95% CI: \n0.19-1.32; I2\u00a0=\u00a00%). Subgroup analysis revealed no significant between-group \ndifferences (p for subgroups\u00a0=\u00a00.612), although numerically lower VaD rates were \nobserved in the T2DM subgroup (RR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.13-1.11).

Glucagon-like peptide-1 \nreceptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are widely used in T2DM management due to their \nability to lower HbA1c, promote weight loss, and offer cardiovascular and renal \nprotection. However, inter-individual variation in therapeutic response has been \nobserved, potentially influenced by gut microbiota composition. A brief review \nwas conducted to explore current evidence on the interaction between GLP-1RAs \nand gut microbiotatermed the \"pharmaco-gut axis.\" Literature was examined to \nunderstand how specific microbial populations affect drug efficacy and insulin \nsensitivity. Studies suggest that certain gut microbes, including Bacteroides \nspecies, Akkermansia muciniphila, and those producing short-chain fatty acids \n(SCFAs), enhance GLP-1RA efficacy by improving insulin sensitivity and \nstimulating endogenous GLP-1 secretion. Conversely, dysbiosis characterized by \nreduced microbial diversity and increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-producing \npro-inflammatory bacteria correlates with poor therapeutic response. \nFurthermore, GLP-1RAs may exert beneficial modulatory effects on the gut \nmicrobiota itself, indicating a bidirectional relationship. The interaction \nbetween GLP-1RAs and gut microbiota introduces a novel pharmaco-gut interface, \nemphasizing the role of microbial composition in drug response. This emerging \nconcept has the potential to enhance precision medicine in diabetes care by \nutilizing microbiome profiling to guide GLP-1RA therapy and improve clinical \noutcomes.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Tehran University of Medical \nSciences 2026.

Participants were randomized \nto one of two implementation strategies: a sequential approach (two months of \neducation first followed by medication initiation) or a bundled approach \n(simultaneous education and medication initiation). Non-clinical navigators and \nclinical pharmacists, supervised by physicians, oversaw medication initiation \nand monitoring under a collaborative drug therapy management agreement and \nprotocol that included algorithms for initiation and titration of SGLT2i and \nGLP1 RA, as well as adjustment of concurrent glucose-lowering medications to \nreduce the risk of hypoglycemia Safety outcomes were collected through chart \nreview and patient report, including targeted AEs, hospitalizations, emergency \ndepartment visits, and urgent care visits. Targeted AEs were prospectively \ncollected over the first six months after enrollment: for SGLT2i initiators, \nsymptoms of genital mycotic infection, urinary tract infection, or volume \ndepletion; for GLP 1 RA initiators, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal \npain. Hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and urgent care visits over \nthe first six months after enrollment were retrospectively collected through \nelectronic health record review.\nRESULTS: Of 200 participants enrolled, 106 (53%) initiated SGLT2i (n=68) or GLP1 \nRA (n=40). Among SGLT2i users, 29.4% reported an AE, most commonly genital \nmycotic infections (10.3%) and symptoms of volume depletion (11.8%); 10.3% \ndiscontinued due to AEs. Among GLP1 RA users, 55.0% experienced AEs, \npredominantly gastrointestinal; 10.0% discontinued due to AEs. No severe \nhypoglycemia, emergency department visits, or hospitalizations occurred.\nCONCLUSIONS: A remote, pharmacist- and navigator-led program safely initiated \nSGLT2i and GLP1 RA in a high-risk T2D population, with AE rates comparable to \nclinical trials and high persistence.

While GLP-1 RAs are commonly associated with \nacute pancreatitis, emerging reports suggest a possible association with \npancreatic cystic lesions, even in patients without typical risks factors such \nas alcohol, gallstones, or hereditary syndromes.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We present two cases of middle-age female patients without \nprior compline or pancreatic disease who developed large distal pancreatic \nmucinous cystic neoplasms following GLP-1 Ras use. Both underwent imaging and \naspiration, which revealed elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. \nSurgical management consisted of distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. \nPathology confirmed MCN with no malignancy. Both patients had uneventful \nrecovery.\nDISCUSSION: These two cases suggest a possible association between GLP-1 \nreceptor agonists, and the development of pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasms \n(MCNs) in patients without prior pancreatic disease or conventional risk \nfactors. While causality cannot be established, the temporal relationship, \nabsence of alternative etiologies, and supportive literature suggest a possible \ndrug-related effect. Preclinical studies have implicated GLP-1 RAs in pancreatic \nductal hyperplasia and cyst formation, and recent clinical reports reinforce \nthese findings. As semaglutide use expands, clinicians should be vigilant for \nstructural pancreatic changes, and further studies are warranted to elucidate \nunderlying mechanisms and clinical implications.\nCONCLUSION: These cases raise concern regarding a potential association between \nsemaglutide therapy and mucinous cystic neoplasms. Increased vigilance and \nfurther observational studies are warranted to evaluate this potential adverse \neffect.\n\n\u00a9 2026.

However, the extent to \nwhich this reduced risk is dependent on, or extends beyond, glucose control and \nweight reduction remains unclear.\nMETHODS: Two-sample cis-Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to assess causal \neffects of GLP-1R activation on HF risk, using glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) \nreduction as a surrogate biomarker. The HF outcome was derived from a \ngenome-wide association meta-analysis that included seven original studies and 1 \n665 481 participants. Primary analyses used inverse variance-weighted (IVW) and \nMR-robust adjusted profile score (MR-RAPS) methods. Mendelian randomization \nBayesian model averaging was used to identify key mediators of the observed \neffects, while multivariable cis-MR with principal component generalized method \nof moments and network cis-MR were used to minimize the impact of confounders.\nRESULTS: Genetically proxied GLP-1R activation was associated with reduced HF \nrisk {IVW: odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] .502 [.339, .743]; \nMR-RAPS: OR [95% CI] .492 [.320, .756]}. Mendelian randomization Bayesian model \naveraging identified body mass index (BMI) (marginal inclusion probability \n67.2%) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) (45.0%) as primary mediators. In multivariable \ncis-MR with principal component generalized method of moments, genetically \npredicted HbA1c levels from the GLP-1R locus remained significantly associated \nwith HF risk after BMI adjustment, even in instances where BMI effects were \nnon-significant [OR (95% CI) 1.663 (1.087, 2.544) at 99% variance threshold]. \nNetwork cis-MR confirmed persistent protection after adjusting for BMI [IVW: OR \n(95% CI) .587 (.394, .877); MR-RAPS: OR (95% CI) .577 (.375, .887)] or T2D [IVW: \nOR (95% CI) .508 (.343, .754); MR-RAPS: OR (95% CI) .499 (.327, .762)].\nCONCLUSIONS: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist-associated HF risk \nreduction is primarily mediated by BMI reduction rather than glucose control, \nbut not fully explained by either. Residual effects after BMI and T2D adjustment \nsuggest direct cardioprotective actions, supporting trials in non-obese, \nnon-diabetic HF patients.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2026.

With the advent of glucagon-like peptide 1 analogues, \nunderstanding the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and clinical \noutcomes in HFrEF is crucial.\nOBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether a BMI\u2009>\u200927\u00a0kg/m2 is associated with \nhigher rates of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure \n(HF) hospitalization in patients with HFrEF.\nMETHODS: A total of 1017 clinically stable and medically optimized HFrEF \npatients from the NorthStar study (enrolled 2005-2009) were analyzed. Patients \nwere followed until 2023 using Danish nationwide registries. The primary outcome \nwas all-cause mortality, while secondary outcomes included cardiovascular \nmortality, HF hospitalization, and a composite of all-cause mortality or HF \nhospitalization. Cox proportional-hazards models adjusted for prognostic factors \nwere used to assess associations. Interaction analyses for the primary outcome \nwere conducted for BMI categories (<\u200924, 24-27,\u2009>\u200927\u00a0kg/m2) and prognostic \nvariables.\nRESULTS: Compared to patients with a BMI of 24-27\u00a0kg/m2, those with a BMI\u2009>\u200927 \nhad a higher prevalence of diabetes (27.8% vs. 17.7%), similar HF etiology \n(ischemic: 57.5% vs. 58.7%), and lower NT-proBNP levels (median 776 vs. \n1163\u00a0pg/mL). Over a median follow-up of 8.8\u00a0years, the primary outcome occurred \nin 235 patients (71.9%) with BMI 24-27, and 338 patients (71.8%) with BMI\u2009>\u200927 \n(ref. BMI 24-27: Hazard ratios (HR) 1.11 [0.94\u2009-\u20091.32]). 124 patients (37.9%) \nand 186 patients (39.5%) died from cardiovascular causes, respectively (HR 1.21 \n[0.96\u2009-\u20091.53]). A first worsening HF event occurred in 214 patients (65.4%) and \n317 patients (67.3%) (HR 1.12 [0.93\u2009-\u20091.33]). A combined outcome of all-cause \ndeath and first worsening HF events occurred in 277 patients (84.7%) and 398 \npatients (84.5%) (HR 1.09 [0.93\u2009-\u20091.27]). The subgroup analyses revealed a \nsignificantly higher mortality rate for BMI\u2009>\u200927 vs 24-27 in patients with \nischemic cardiomyopathy (HR 1.31 [1.05-1.64]), but not in patients with \nnon-ischemic cardiomyopathy (HR 0.86 [0.66-1.12]).\nCONCLUSION: In HFrEF patients, a BMI\u2009>\u200927 was not associated with increased \nmortality, contradicting the \"obesity-survival paradox.\" In fact, patients with \nischemic cardiomyopathy and a BMI\u2009>\u200927 may be associated with a higher mortality \nrate.\n\n\u00a9 2026.

Data were pooled using a \nrandom-effects model. Risk of bias analyses were performed.\nRESULTS: Ninety studies met inclusion criteria. GLP-1RAs produced modest \nimprovements in glycaemic control, lowering glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) \n(-0.56%) and increasing time-in-range (TIR), while reducing total and basal \ndaily insulin requirements, body weight (-3.6\u2009kg) and body mass index (BMI) \n(-1.05\u2009kg/m2). Severe hypoglycaemia and DKA were rare; gastrointestinal adverse \neffects were the most common adverse effects; renal and cardiovascular outcomes \nwere neutral. SGLT2is significantly improved HbA1c (-0.38%), TIR (+8.6\u2009pp), \ninsulin requirements (-4.7\u2009U/day), body weight (-2.5\u2009kg) and BMI (-0.82\u2009kg/m2). \nSevere hypoglycaemia was uncommon, while DKA risk was increased (risk \nratios\u2009=\u20092.19, 95% confidence interval 1.16-4.17), primarily in predictable \nclinical settings. Renal parameters remained stable or improved, and \ncardiovascular events were infrequent. Across drug classes, mortality and \nhospitalisations were rare.\nCONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is provide modest clinical \nimprovements in adults with type 1 diabetes. These benefits must be balanced \nagainst class-specific safety concerns, especially the increased risk of DKA \nwith SGLT2-based therapies. Larger, long-term trials are needed to define their \noptimal use in routine care.\n\n\u00a9 2026 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n\nDOI: 10.1111/dom.70506\nPMID: 41605813"

Patients with diabetes and a history of MALE who \ninitiated GLP-1 RAs or DPP-4 inhibitors were included. MALEs were defined as \nchronic limb-threatening ischemia, lower limb revascularization, or nontraumatic \nminor and major amputation.\nEXPOSURES: Initiation of GLP-1 RAs (liraglutide, dulaglutide, or semaglutide) vs \nDPP-4 inhibitors.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of lower limb \nrevascularization and nontraumatic major and minor amputation. The secondary \noutcomes were MACEs (cardiovascular death, ischemic stroke, and myocardial \ninfarction), all-cause mortality, and progression to long-term dialysis. A \nnew-user, active-comparator design with inverse probability of treatment \nweighting was employed.\nRESULTS: Among 17\u202f288 patients (mean [SD] age, 70.7 [12.0] years; 10\u202f010 male \n[57.9%]), 1583 initiated GLP-1 RAs and 15\u202f705 initiated DPP-4 inhibitors. After \nweighting, the use of GLP-1 RAs was associated with a lower risk of MALEs \n(subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83-0.97), primarily due to \na marked reduction in amputation (SHR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.98). GLP-1 RAs were \nalso associated with reduced risks of MACEs (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.58-0.65), \ncardiovascular death (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.53-0.61), all-cause mortality (HR \n0.63; 95% CI, 0.60-0.66), and progression to dialysis (SHR, 0.61; 95% CI, \n0.54-0.70).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this nationwide cohort study of patients with \ndiabetes and prior MALEs, treatment with GLP-1 RAs was associated with \nsignificantly lower risks of recurrent limb events, cardiovascular events, \nall-cause mortality, and kidney disease progression compared with DPP-4 \ninhibitors. These findings support the preferential use of GLP-1 RAs for \nsecondary prevention in this high-risk population.\n\nDOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.55952\nPMCID: PMC12853205\nPMID: 41604151 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported."

In \nplacebo-controlled trials, significant differences in incident AF were observed \nwith treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with \nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (RR \n0.69, 95% CI 0.60-0.80), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (RR 0.62, 95% CI \n0.43-0.90), and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (RR 0.62, 95% \nCI 0.44-0.87); treatment of chronic kidney disease with SGLT2 inhibitors (RR \n0.53, 95% CI 0.33-0.85); and treatment of obesity with glucagon-like peptide-1 \nreceptor agonists (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99). However, the number of AF events \nper trial was low and none were adequately powered for incident AF.\nCONCLUSIONS: Prospective RCTs with AF as a pre-specified outcome should be \nintegrated into the design of future trials of cardio-renal-metabolic \nmedications to determine whether they reduce incident AF.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2026.

Despite extensive epidemiological evidence linking the two \nconditions, the underlying mechanisms and the influence of glucose-lowering \ntherapies on AF susceptibility remain incompletely defined. This review aims to \nsummarize the current knowledge on the pathophysiological pathways linking DM \nand AF and to assess the impact of commonly used antidiabetic therapies on \narrhythmic risk. We conducted a narrative review of epidemiological studies, \nmechanistic research, and cardiovascular outcome trials that evaluate the \nassociation between DM and AF. We included data addressing structural, \nelectrical, autonomic, metabolic, and inflammatory mechanisms of AF in diabetes, \nas well as clinical evidence regarding the impact of metformin, insulin, \ndipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 \n(SGLT-2) inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists on AF \nincidence or recurrence. Results: DM promotes AF development through multiple \ncomplementary mechanisms, including atrial fibrosis, electrical conduction \nabnormalities, autonomic dysfunction, inflammation, glycemic fluctuations, \noxidative stress, and expansion of epicardial adipose tissue. These changes \ncreate a vulnerable atrial substrate that facilitates both initiation and \nmaintenance of AF. Evidence from recent trials indicates that the arrhythmic \neffects of glucose-lowering therapies are heterogeneous. Metformin and SGLT-2 \ninhibitors appear to offer favorable or neutral effects on AF risk. GLP-1 \nreceptor agonists provide substantial cardiovascular benefits, although their \nspecific impact on AF remains under investigation. Insulin therapy has been \nlinked to a higher AF risk, whereas DPP-4 inhibitors show an overall neutral \neffect with inconsistent findings across studies. Conclusions: AF in patients \nwith DM results from complex interactions between metabolic disturbances, \nstructural remodeling, and inflammatory activation. Although several \nantidiabetic drugs appear to have potential antiarrhythmic effects, further \ndedicated research is needed to clarify their role in AF prevention and \nmanagement.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/life16010016\nPMCID: PMC12842679\nPMID: 41598171\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest."

We evaluated the effect of dipeptidyl \npeptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibition on the response of plasma triglycerides (TGs) to \nintraduodenal lipid and a mixed meal, and the impact of GLP-1 receptor blockade \nwith exendin(9-39) in T2D. Fifteen participants with T2D, managed by diet and/or \nmetformin, were studied on three occasions in a double-blind, randomized, \ncrossover design. Vildagliptin (50 mg) or placebo was administered orally (t = \n-60 min), followed by intravenous exendin(9-39) from t = -60 to 150 min on one \nof the two vildagliptin days or 0.9% saline on two other days. A lipid emulsion \nwas infused intraduodenally (2 kcal/min, t = 0-120 min), followed by a mixed \nmeal (t = 120-150 min). Plasma TG levels, quantified by liquid \nchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, increased after lipid and meal, with \nmost individual TGs corresponding to those in the lipid emulsion. Vildagliptin \nreduced TG(54:4) and TG(54:5) concentrations (each P < 0.01), without affecting \ntotal TGs. Blocking endogenous GLP-1 during vildagliptin treatment increased \nplasma total TGs (P < 0.001), associated with elevations of 10 individual TG \nspecies (P < 0.05 each). These outcomes suggest that endogenous GLP-1 \ncontributes to the physiological modulation of postprandial TG appearance in \nT2D.\nARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS: The contribution of endogenous glucagon-like peptide 1 \n(GLP-1) to postprandial lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is poorly \ndefined. The specific questions we wanted to answer were what is the effect of \ndipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibition on plasma triglyceride (TG) profiles \nduring an intraduodenal lipid infusion and following a mixed meal in T2D, and \nhow does blockage of endogenous GLP-1 signaling affect these responses? We found \nthat plasma TGs increased after intraduodenal lipid infusion and the meal, with \nmost species reflecting the infused lipid emulsion. Vildagliptin selectively \nreduced TG(54:4) and TG(54:5) species, whereas exendin(9-39) increased total TGs \nand 10 individual TG species. The implications of our finding are that \nendogenous GLP-1 plays a physiological role in the regulation of postprandial \nlipid handling in T2D.\n\n\u00a9 2026 by the American Diabetes Association.\n\nDOI: 10.2337/db25-0980\nPMID: 41591292"

The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death and heart \nfailure (HF) hospitalisation. The secondary outcomes included cardiovascular \ndeath, all-cause mortality, worsening HF events, change in the 6-min walk test \n(6MWT) distance, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score \n(KCCQ-CSS) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. A frequentist \nrandom-effects NMA was conducted.\nRESULTS: Thirty-nine trials with 78 treatment arms and 48\u2009235 patients were \nenrolled. Compared with placebo, GLP-1 RAs (HR: 0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.88) and \nSGLT2is (HR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.70-0.90; P-score: 0.807) significantly reduced the \nrisk of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalisation. GLP-1 RAs showed the \nhighest probability of ranking first (P-score: 0.871). GLP-1 RAs elicited the \ngreatest improvement in functional outcomes, including the 6MWT (mean \ndifference: +17.60\u2009m, 95% CI 8.53-26.67) and KCCQ-CSS (mean difference: +7.38 \npoints, 95% CI 5.51-9.26). No statistically significant differences in \ncardiovascular death or all-cause mortality were observed among the treatments.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with HFpEF, GLP-1RA, SGLT2i and MRA significantly \nreduced the risk of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalisation, while GLP-1RA \nadditionally improved the functional and quality-of-life outcomes. GLP-1RA and \nSGLT2i significantly reduced HF morbidity, and GLP-1RA uniquely improved \nfunctional status, positioning adiposity modulation as a central therapeutic \ntarget in HFpEF.\n\n\u00a9 2026 The Author(s).

This narrative \nreview discusses approaches to diagnosing and treating PSS, as well as the \nvarious pharmacological agents available.

Early identification and risk-adapted \nintervention are crucial to improving long-term outcomes, yet existing clinical \nworkflows are limited by delayed diagnosis and underutilization of available \ntherapies.\nMETHODS: We propose and evaluate a multimodal, risk-driven framework for the \nearly recognition and individualized management of DKD. The approach integrates: \n(1) standard renal function metrics-estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \nand urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR)-together with validated prediction \nmodels; (2) molecular biomarkers including metabolomics, gut microbiota, and \nperitoneal dialysis effluent signatures; (3) digital phenotypes derived from \nstandardized acquisition of tongue images and pulse waveforms, rooted in \nTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnostics; and (4) longitudinal data from \nwearable devices and remote monitoring platforms. Digital features are \nquantified using image processing and optical signal analysis and incorporated \ninto multimodal prediction models. Treatment is escalated based on risk \nstratification using renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, \nsodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, non-steroidal \nmineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and glucagon-like peptide-1 \n(GLP-1) receptor agonists. Real-time monitoring of therapeutic efficacy and \nsafety is conducted using process end points such as eGFR slope and uACR trends.\nRESULTS: Incorporation of quantifiable tongue and pulse features provides a \nnovel, low-cost, and non-invasive risk enrichment layer that complements \nbiochemical and omics-based markers. Multilayered risk stratification enables \nearlier identification of fast progressors and more timely treatment \nintensification. Evidence from landmark trials-including Dapagliflozin and \nPrevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD), \nEmpagliflozin in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (EMPA-KIDNEY), Finerenone \nin Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease \n(FIDELIO-DKD), and Effects of Semaglutide on Chronic Kidney Disease \n(FLOW)-supports the clinical utility of this approach. A closed-loop monitoring \nstrategy based on process metrics and safety thresholds is proposed. We also \noutline ethical, regulatory, and data governance considerations necessary for \nclinical translation.\nCONCLUSION: The integration of traditional clinical markers, digital TCM-derived \nphenotypes, and multi-omics data represents a promising paradigm for early, \npersonalized, and dynamic DKD care. Future research should focus on external \nvalidation, impact on hard end points, and equitable deployment across \nreal-world settings. This approach may help close the current diagnostic and \ntherapeutic gaps in DKD management.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 Meng, Li, Xu, Wei, Ji, Zhang, Zhu and Zhou.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fendo.2025.1728293\nPMCID: PMC12827177\nPMID: 41585789 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The author(s) declared that this work was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."

Liraglutide, \nempagliflozin, and their combination induced greater reduction of cIMT (-8.2, \n-5.6, and -10.7% vs. -1.7%) and A\u03b21-40 (-52.1, -40.3, and -50.7% vs. -30.7%; P < \n0.05) compared with insulin. cIMT regression was associated with A\u03b21-40 and MDA \nreductions (P < 0.05). In T2DM patients, GLP-1RA and SGLT-2i-particularly in \ncombination-were associated with improvements in carotid atherosclerotic burden, \namyloid-related vascular injury, and oxidative stress.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We \ninvestigated the effect of insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists \n(GLP-1RA), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), and their \ncombination on carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and amyloid-\u03b21-40 (A\u03b21-40) \nin diabetes. Twelve-month treatment with GLP-1RA, SGLT-2i, and their combination \nconfers significant reductions in cIMT and A\u03b21-40 compared with insulin. cIMT \nregression was associated with A\u03b21-40 and malondialdehyde reductions. Our \nfindings support that newer antidiabetic agents can favorably modify structural \nand biochemical markers of atherosclerosis.\n\nDOI: 10.1152/ajpheart.00996.2025\nPMID: 41579346 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

The exercise program was a \ncombination of group sessions (interval-based indoor cycling followed by circuit \ntraining) and individual sessions of moderate-to-vigorous intensity, designed to \nmeet the World Health Organization recommendations on physical activity for \nhealth. Exercise adherence was measured with sports watches and heart rate \nmonitors. Key secondary endpoints related to physical fitness were changes from \nrandomization to the end of treatment (weeks 0-52) in: (1) physical functional \nperformance (time to ascend and descend an 11-step stairway twice); (2) \ncardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption normalized to fat-free mass); \nand (3) muscle strength (isometric knee extensor peak torque).\nRESULTS: Participants randomized to exercise performed a median 2.65 \nsession/week (116\u00a0min/week at 79% of maximum heart rate) with no significant \ndifference between those who received placebo or liraglutide. Compared with \nliraglutide alone, the combined treatment decreased time to complete a stair \nclimb test by 1.2\u00a0s [95% confidence interval 0.6-1.9] (corresponding to 8.6%) \nand improved peak oxygen consumption by 3.0\u00a0mL/min/kg fat-free mass [95% \nconfidence interval 0.5-5.5]. Exercise alone led to similar benefits, whereas \nliraglutide alone did not improve physical fitness. Compared with placebo \n(-\u20097.8%), relative muscle strength (strength normalized to body weight) was \nhigher with exercise (-\u20090.4%), liraglutide (+\u20091.0%), and the combined treatment \n(+\u20093.3%) because of lower weight and preserved absolute strength.\nCONCLUSIONS: Structured exercise combined with glucagon-like peptide-1-based \nobesity pharmacotherapy led to clinically meaningful improvements in physical \nfunctional performance and cardiorespiratory fitness, in contrast to \npharmacotherapy alone.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT number, 2015-005585-32; ClinicalTrials.gov \nnumber, NCT04122716.\n\n\u00a9 2026.

We aimed to compare the effectiveness in routine clinical settings of \nincident use of either GLP-1 RA, SGLT2i or DPP-4i among type 2 diabetes on the \nstroke risk and as secondary outcomes myocardial infarction and all-cause \nmortality.\nMETHODS: A nationwide population-based cohort study consisted of persons with \ntype 2 diabetes who were new users of a GLP-1 RA, SGLT2i or DPP-4i and without \nprior stroke from 2014 to 2020 in Denmark using an active comparator design. \nThey were followed from initiation of medication up to a maximum of 2\u2009years for \nincident outcomes. Estimates were adjusted for age, sex, calendar year of \ninitiation, socio-economic factors, medication and co-morbidity.\nRESULTS: The study included 19,999 new users of a GLP-1 RA; 24,702 of a SGLT2i \nand 41,943 of a DPP-4i. The new users of GLP-1 RA had a lower incidence of \nstroke when compared to new users of DPP-4i, adjusted hazard rate ratios (aHRR): \n0.69 95% confidence interval (0.53-0.91). There was no significant difference in \nstroke incidence between the new users of SGLT2i versus DPP4-4i and SGLT2i \nversus GLP-1 RA: aHRR 0.80 (0.64-1.01) and 1.17 (0.87-1.57). The new users of \nGLP-1 RA and SGLT2i had lower risk of mortality in comparison with new users of \nDPP-4i. The risk of myocardial infarction was not significantly different \nbetween the compared groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: New users of GLP-1 RA with type 2 diabetes had a lower risk of \nfirst stroke and new users of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i had lower mortality.

Its development involves not only actively \nregulated biological processes but also passive mineral deposition and is \nparticularly prevalent in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and \nendocrine disorders. Although conventional therapies-such as phosphate binders, \ncalcium channel blockers, bisphosphonates, and endovascular interventions-form \nthe current clinical foundation, they remain inadequate for preventing early VC \nor reversing established lesions. This review systematically summarizes advances \nin both standard strategies and emerging therapies. Recent studies have \nhighlighted several breakthrough approaches: nanotechnology-based delivery \nsystems, optimized agents such as SNF472 and GLP-1 receptor agonists, and \nbioactive constituents from traditional Chinese medicine (e.g., ginsenosides, \nchelerythrine), all of which target distinct calcification pathways. In \naddition, dietary interventions and lifestyle modification show preventive \nvalue. Progress in multi-omics technologies continues to uncover new molecular \nmechanisms and therapeutic targets, guiding precision medicine. By integrating \nmechanistic insights with novel therapeutic paradigms, this review aims to \nfacilitate the development of personalized management strategies and ultimately \nimprove cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk populations.\n\n\u00a9 2026.

By producing potent, sustained weight reduction and \nfavourable changes in lipids, blood pressure, systemic inflammation and \nendothelial biology, tirzepatide targets central pathophysiologic drivers of \nobesity-related HFpEF.\nMETHODS: We conducted this review to synthesise current evidence on the \nmechanisms, clinical efficacy and therapeutic implications of tirzepatide for \nheart failure management, with emphasis on obesity-related HFpEF, cardiorenal \neffects and safety considerations. Randomised clinical programmes and the SUMMIT \noutcomes trial have demonstrated symptomatic and functional improvements, \nreverse cardiac remodelling on imaging, reduced circulating markers of \nmyocardial stress and fewer worsening heart-failure events versus placebo, \nalongside signals of renal stabilisation.\nRESULTS: The tolerability profile aligns with the GLP-1 class, with \ngastrointestinal events predominating and a low risk of clinically important \nhypoglycemia; biliary events may be more likely at higher doses, while \npancreatitis risk has not been clearly elevated. Data in HFrEF remain limited \nand caution is advised given prior mixed results with incretin therapies and \ntheoretical concerns about rapid weight loss in advanced systolic failure.\nCONCLUSION: This review integrates mechanistic insights and contemporary trial \nevidence to clarify how dual incretin agonism may modify the trajectory of \nobesity-driven heart failure, to inform multidisciplinary clinical decision \nmaking, and to highlight key unanswered questions and research priorities needed \nto define tirzepatide's full role in heart failure management.\n\n\u00a9 2026 The Author(s).

Optum's \nde-identified Clinformatics\u00ae Data Mart, a commercial claims database in the US, \nfrom January 01, 2014-August 31, 2023 was used.\nPARTICIPANTS: GRADE-eligible patients (T2DM, age\u2009\u2265\u200930\u00a0years, on metformin \nmonotherapy, no recent cardiovascular events, baseline HbA1c 6-9%).\nINTERVENTIONS: Incident use of SGLT-2i, SU, GLP-1RA or DPP-4i.\nMAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was the first occurrence of HbA1c\u2009\u2265\u20097.0%. \nPropensity score weights emulated random treatment assignment; hazard ratios \n(HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox regression \nmodels.\nKEY RESULTS: The weighted cohort included 2,065 SGLT-2i, 2,015 SU, 2,006 \nGLP-1RA, and 2,006 DPP-4i initiators. GLP-1RAs had a lower risk of HbA1c\u2009\u2265\u20097.0% \nvs. SUs (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.68-0.78) and DPP-4is (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.60-0.70). \nSGLT-2is had risk of HbA1c\u2009\u2265\u20097.0% comparable to DPP-4is (HR 1.04; 95% CI \n0.97-1.10) but higher than GLP-1RAs (HR 1.60; 95% CI 1.48-1.72) and SUs (HR \n1.17; 95% CI 1.11-1.23). Subgroups and sensitivity analyses showed consistent \nresults.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this target trial emulation, GLP-1RAs were most effective for \nglycemic control, aligning with GRADE, and superior to SGLT-2is in combination \nwith metformin for T2DM in patients with low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk.\n\n\u00a9 2026.

Hazard ratios (HRs) for MACE were extracted for Asian, Black \nor African American, and White populations. Random-effects meta-analyses were \nused to obtain pooled HRs and ratios of HRs (RHRs) comparing treatment effects \nbetween populations.\nRESULTS: Nine trials, including the recent SOUL trial, were included, comprising \n8164 Asian, 4036 Black or African American, and 62\u2009503 White participants. \nGLP-1RAs reduced MACE risk in Asian (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.63-0.85; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and \nWhite populations (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.81-0.91; p\u2009<\u20090.001). In Black or African \nAmerican populations, the effect was similar to that in White populations (HR \n0.88; 95% CI 0.67-1.15; p\u2009=\u20090.34) but did not reach statistical significance. \nThe pooled RHR for Asian versus White populations was 0.84 (95% CI 0.71-0.98; \np\u2009=\u20090.027), indicating a significantly greater risk reduction in Asian \npopulations. The RHR for Asian versus Black or African American populations was \n0.81 (95% CI 0.57-1.16; p\u2009=\u20090.25), with point estimates favouring Asian \npopulations.\nCONCLUSIONS: GLP-1RAs reduced MACE risk across populations, with greater \nrelative risk reduction in Asian populations and broadly similar benefits in \nBlack or African American and White populations.\n\n\u00a9 2026 The Author(s).

The aim of this review was to summarize and \ncritically evaluate the available evidence on the effects of semaglutide and \ntirzepatide in individuals with prediabetes, focusing on diabetes prevention and \ncardiovascular (CV) outcomes.\nMETHODS: A narrative synthesis of data from randomized controlled trials, \nmeta-analyses, and real-world studies assessing semaglutide and tirzepatide in \npeople with prediabetes.\nRESULTS: Across the STEP 1, STEP 5, and SELECT trials, semaglutide 2.4\u202fmg \nsignificantly increased regression to normoglycemia (up to 84\u202f%) and reduced the \nrisk of progression to diabetes compared with placebo. In the SURMOUNT-1 trial, \ntirzepatide reduced the incidence of diabetes by nearly 90\u202f% (Hazard Ratio: \n0.07; p\u202f<\u202f0.001), an effect largely mediated by substantial weight loss. \nRegarding CV outcomes, the SELECT trial, of which 66.4\u202f% of participants had \nprediabetes, demonstrated a significant reduction in the primary composite \nendpoint of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke with \nsemaglutide versus placebo (hazard ratio 0.80; 95\u202f% CI: 0.72-0.90). A \nprespecified analysis showed that CV risk reduction was independent of baseline \nHbA1c, supporting CV benefit in people with prediabetes. The ongoing \nSURMOUNT-MMO trial will further clarify the CV effects of tirzepatide in \nindividuals with obesity without diabetes.\nCONCLUSION: Semaglutide and tirzepatide markedly increase regression to \nnormoglycemia and reduce progression to diabetes in people with obesity and \nprediabetes. Semaglutide has also demonstrated CV benefit in SELECT, including \namong participants with prediabetes. Ongoing outcome data, particularly from \nSURMOUNT-MMO, will further define the cardioprotective potential of GLP-1-based \nmedicines across the dysglycemia spectrum.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 Primary Care Diabetes Europe.

Single, dual, and even \ntriple drug combinations are being researched throughout all phases of clinical \ntrials. The similarities in GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon peptide sequences enable \nthe development of unimolecular multi-receptor activating agonists and/or \nantagonists. Furthermore, subcutaneously administered peptides are being \nsupplemented with oral analogs currently in development. Both well-designed \nclinical trials and real-world evidence are fuelling the development of incretin \nand multi-agonist-based therapies, thereby holding the promise to deliver an \nincreasing double-digit percent weight loss in addition to addressing many \nobesity-related comorbidities and complications. It is increasingly evident that \nearly initiation of incretin-based therapy across a broad spectrum of \ncardio-kidney-metabolic disorders improves body weight, dysglycemia, and \ncardiovascular risk factor management and consequently is expected to reduce \ncardio-kidney-liver-metabolic and vascular morbidity and mortality and soon most \nprobably those from obesity-related malignancies, Alzheimer's, and other \nneurocognitive diseases. This review explores new incretin- and \nmulti-agonist-based therapies undergoing clinical trials for chronic weight \nmanagement, type 2 diabetes mellitus with its complications, chronic kidney \ndisease, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and \nobstructive sleep apnea; it also highlights areas of uncertainty regarding the \npotency, safety, tolerability, and sustainability of incretin-based approaches \nfor obesity and cardio-kidney-liver-metabolic disorders and finally, we discuss \nfuture directions.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 Elsevier Inc.

Whether kidney failure risk modifies the comparative \neffectiveness of GLP-1 RA versus SGLT2i is clinically relevant.\nMETHODS: We defined a national veterans cohort with type 2 diabetes who \ninitiated an SGLT2i, non-exendin GLP-1 RA or insulin glargine between 1/1/2018 \nand 12/31/2021. After applying inverse probability of treatment weighting to \nbalance baseline characteristics, outcomes were compared across new-user groups \nthrough 3/31/2023. Outcomes included kidney failure (stage 5 chronic kidney \ndisease or long-term renal replacement therapy), major adverse cardiac events \n(MACE: heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke), CKM composite (kidney \nfailure or MACE), all-cause death and composites of outcomes with death. We \ntested for effect modification by the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) score \non comparative pairwise drug effectiveness.\nRESULTS: Out of 160,428 veterans, 53%, 14% and 34% were new-users of SGLT2i, \nGLP-1 RA and insulin glargine, respectively. Relative to GLP-1 RA new-users, \nSGLT2i new-users had similar mortality risk, a trend toward lower kidney failure \nrisk (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.74-1.06), but higher risk of MACE (HR 1.14, 95% CI \n1.09-1.20) and CKM composite (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.08-1.19). The effect of SGLT2i \nversus GLP-1 RA differed significantly between moderate-risk (2 to 6%) and \nhigh-risk (\u22656%) KFRE subgroups for all outcomes except all-cause death. In those \nwith moderate-risk KFRE, GLP-1 RA appeared more protective for kidney failure, \nMACE, and CKM composite, while SGLT2i appeared more protective in those with \nhigh-risk KFRE.\nCONCLUSIONS: Compared to GLP-1 RA, SGLT2i had comparable risks of mortality, \nperhaps a lower risk of kidney failure, but modestly higher risk of \ncardiovascular events in the entire cohort. However, GLP-1 RA were more \nbeneficial in those with moderate kidney failure risk and SGLT2i more beneficial \nin those with high kidney failure risk.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 by the American Society of Nephrology.\n\nDOI: 10.1681/ASN.0000001016\nPMID: 41563358"

differences in a substudy of participants in the \nGlycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study \n(GRADE).\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: GRADE participants (type 2 diabetes duration <10 \nyears, HbA1c 6.8%-8.5%, on metformin alone) were randomly assigned to add \ninsulin glargine, glimepiride, liraglutide, or sitagliptin. Adherence was \nmeasured semiannually for 3 years using a validated three-item scale (0-100, \nlowest to highest adherence) in a substudy (N = 1,739). Analyses included \nevaluation of adherence over time and testing treatment group differences in \nadherence and in the association between adherence and primary (HbA1c \u22657.0%) and \nsecondary (HbA1c >7.5%) glycemic outcomes.\nRESULTS: Overall mean \u00b1 SD adherence (average of participant-level mean \u00b1 SD) \nwas high over 3 years of follow-up at 88.7 \u00b1 10.01, on a scale of 0-100, and \ndecreased slightly by 3 years relative to baseline (-2.0\u00a0\u00b1 14.7; P < 0.0001). No \nintergroup differences were observed until 3 years, when adherence was 5% and 3% \nhigher for the glimepiride and sitagliptin groups, respectively, than for \nliraglutide (both P < 0.05). Over follow-up and across groups, a 10-point \ndecrease in adherence was associated with 15% and 19% increased risk of reaching \nprimary (HbA1c \u22657.0%) and secondary (HbA1c >7.5%) glycemic outcomes (both P < \n0.0001).

Participants were individuals with metformin-treated type 2 diabetes \nwho initiated SGLT2i or GLP-1RA treatment from January 2014 to November 2020, \nwith follow-up through October 2024.\nEXPOSURE: Initiation of an SGLT2i or a GLP-1RA.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 2 coprimary outcomes were chronic kidney disease \n(CKD; 40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], severe \nalbuminuria, or kidney failure) and acute kidney injury (AKI). Secondary \noutcomes included the individual components of CKD, albuminuria, and death. \nIntention-to-treat effects were estimated using inverse probability of treatment \nweights, comparing risks for CKD assessed by the Aalen-Johansen estimator, and \nAKI burden by mean cumulative counts (MCCs; mean number of events per individual \nas multiple AKI events were possible). Subgroup analyses included stratification \nby preexisting cardiovascular or kidney disease.\nRESULTS: The study included 36\u202f279 individuals who initiated an SGLT2i and \n18\u202f782 who initiated a GLP-1RA (median [IQR] age, 63 [55-71] years vs 61 [52-70] \nyears), with comparable diabetes duration, eGFR, and urine albumin-creatinine \nratios. The weighted 5-year risk of CKD was 6.7% (95% CI, 6.4%-7.0%) for SGLT2i \ninitiators and 8.2% (95% CI, 7.8%-8.6%) for GLP-1RA initiators (risk ratio: 0.81 \n[95% CI, 0.76-0.87]; risk difference: -1.5% [95% CI, -2.0% to -1.0%]). The \n5-year MCC of AKI per 100 individuals was 25.2 (95% CI, 24.4-26.1) for SGLT2i \ninitiators and 28.7 (95% CI, 27.4-30.0) for GLP-1RA initiators (MCC ratio: 0.88 \n[95% CI, 0.83-0.93]; MCC difference: -3.5 [95% CI, -5.0 to -2.0]). In contrast, \nthe secondary outcomes of albuminuria and mortality were slightly reduced in \nGLP-1RA initiators. Results were consistent across subgroups, with the most \npronounced CKD and AKI reductions with SGLT2i observed among individuals without \npreexisting kidney disease.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This comparative effectiveness study found that \ninitiation of SGLT2i vs GLP-1RA treatment in individuals with type 2 diabetes \nwas associated with a lower 5-year risk of CKD and a lower 5-year count of AKI. \nThese findings underscore the potential of SGLT2i treatment for primary \nprevention of kidney disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes.\n\nDOI: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.7409\nPMCID: PMC12820778\nPMID: 41557360\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Drs \nHeide-J\u00f8rgensen and Andersen reported being involved, through the Department of \nClinical Epidemiology, in studies with funding from various companies as \nresearch grants to (and administered by) Aarhus University; none of these \nstudies are related to the current study.

Because this potential has not been mechanistically \nilluminated in the setting of CAD and metabolic syndrome, we used a large animal \nmodel to evaluate the cardiac consequences of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonism. \nSixteen Yorkshire swine, after provision of a high-fat diet for 5 wk to induce \nmetabolic syndrome, underwent ameroid constrictor-mediated induction of focal \nCAD. Animals were then either randomized to receive semaglutide (SEM, n = 8, 4 \nmales, 4 females) or no drug (CON, n = 8, 4 males, 4 females) for 5 wk, followed \nby a terminal sternotomy for left ventricular pressure-volume catheterization, \ncoronary collateral characterization, and myocardial resection and sectioning. \nCoronary arterioles from the peri-ischemic myocardium were mounted and suffused \nto assess vasoactivity, and molecular changes within the most ischemic territory \nwere assayed using immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and proteomics.

Obstructive \nsleep apnea (OSA) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) are among the \nserious sleep-related comorbidities in obese children, contributing to impaired \nquality of life, cognitive deficits, and cardiovascular risks. These conditions \nfrequently coexist with other obesity-related complications such as insulin \nresistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease \n(NAFLD). This review explores the importance of multidisciplinary care in \naddressing pediatric obesity, emphasizing early diagnosis, nutritional \ncounseling, physical activity interventions, psychological support, and \npharmacologic therapies such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor \nagonists. The role of global trends, academic performance, and wellbeing clinics \nare also discussed. Although promising, the use of GLP-1s and surgical \ninterventions in pediatrics remains constrained by limited data, particularly \nconcerning their impact on sleep disorders. Further research is essential to \nclarify the long-term effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists and bariatric surgery \nnot only on obesity and sleep-related comorbidities such as OSA and OHS, but \nalso on cognitive function, psychosocial wellbeing, and overall health \noutcomes-thereby informing evidence-based, multidisciplinary approaches to \npediatric obesity management.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 Inja and Cielo.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/frsle.2025.1634185\nPMCID: PMC12807914\nPMID: 41550266\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."

Adult patients with type 2 diabetes diagnosed with \ncolorectal cancer between 2010 and 2025 were included. Patients were divided \ninto two cohorts based on GLP1-RA exposure versus other oral antidiabetic drugs. \nPropensity score matching was applied to balance covariates.

This phenomenon is \npredominantly attributed to disruption of critical hypothalamic regulatory \ncircuits, caused either by direct tumor infiltration or by treatment-related \ninjury. Hypothalamic obesity is best conceptualized within the broader framework \nof hypothalamic syndrome, a complex clinical disorder encompassing multiple \nneuroendocrine deficits, impairments in circadian homeostasis, dysregulation of \nhunger, satiety, and thirst mechanisms, disturbances in thermoregulatory \ncontrol, and a wide range of cognitive, sleep-related, and psychosocial \nabnormalities. Hypothalamic syndrome may also develop secondary to nonmalignant \nparasellar pathologies, including germ cell tumors, gliomas, Rathke's cleft \ncyst, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis, as well as traumatic hypothalamic \ninjury following traumatic brain insult. Long-term prognosis is frequently poor, \ndriven by elevated risks of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, \ndiminished health-related quality of life, and increased rates of premature \nmortality. Management remains particularly challenging. Recently, a personalized \nand risk-stratified therapeutic framework has been proposed to guide clinical \ndecision-making and optimize outcomes. Several pharmacologic interventions, such \nas centrally acting stimulants, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and \nthe melanocortin-4 receptor agonist setmelanotide, have demonstrated potential \nin promoting weight reduction. Bariatric surgery may also yield clinical \nbenefit; however, the use of irreversible procedures in pediatric populations \npresents substantial ethical and legal challenges. There remains an urgent need \nfor therapeutic strategies that emphasize preservation of hypothalamic structure \nand function, alongside continued research into targeted and emerging \ninterventions for more effective management of hypothalamic syndrome.\n\nDOI: 10.4274/jcrpe.galenos.2025.2025-12-12\nPMID: 41537273"

Glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have \ngained prominence because they improve glycemic control and aid weight reduction \nby slowing gastric emptying and promoting satiety. Liraglutide is a once-daily \nhuman GLP-1 analogue marketed for T2DM (at 1.8 mg) and weight management (3.0 \nmg), whereas semaglutide is a more potent GLP-1 RA administered once weekly at \ndoses of 1.0 mg (diabetes) and 2.4 mg (weight management). Randomized controlled \ntrials suggest that semaglutide yields greater weight loss and HbA1c reduction \nthan liraglutide [1, 2], yet comparative data in real-world South Asian \npopulations are limited.\nMETHODS: We performed a prospective, open-label, randomized study at Lady \nReading Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan. Adults with obesity (BMI \u2265 30 kg/m2) or \noverweight (BMI \u2265 27 kg/m2) with T2DM were randomized (1:1) to once-weekly \nsemaglutide 2.4 mg plus lifestyle counselling or once-daily liraglutide 3.0 mg \nplus the same counselling. The primary outcome was the percentage change in body \nweight at 68 weeks. Secondary outcomes included proportions achieving \nweight-loss thresholds (\u2265 5%, \u2265 10 % and \u2265 15 %) [3]; change in HbA1c [4], \nfasting glucose, waist circumference, blood pressure, lipid profile, \npatient-reported quality of life, and adverse events. Mean changes were compared \nusing t-tests; categorical outcomes were compared using \u03c72 tests.\nRESULTS: Two hundred forty participants (mean age 45.6 \u00b1 9.8 years, 52 % women) \nwere enrolled. At 68 weeks, semaglutide recipients lost significantly more \nweight than liraglutide recipients (-14.7 \u00b1 5.8 % vs -6.2 \u00b1 4.9 %; p < 0.001), \nconsistent with STEP 8 trial findings [1]. A greater proportion of semaglutide \npatients achieved \u2265 10 % and \u2265 15 % weight loss (70.9 % and 55 %) compared with \nliraglutide (25.6 % and 12 %) [3]. HbA1c decreased by -1.6 \u00b1 0.4 % with \nsemaglutide versus -1.0 \u00b1 0.4 % with liraglutide (p < 0.001), mirroring \nSUSTAIN-10 differences [5]. Gastrointestinal adverse events were common but \nsimilar between groups (83.5 % vs 82.0 %); nausea and vomiting occurred more \nfrequently with semaglutide [6].\nCONCLUSIONS: In a real-world Pakistani cohort, once-weekly semaglutide produced \nsubstantially greater weight loss and HbA1c reduction than daily liraglutide, \nwith comparable tolerability. These findings support the preferential use of \nsemaglutide for weight management and glycemic control, particularly when \nonce-weekly dosing improves adherence. Further studies should explore long-term \nsustainability, cardiovascular benefits, cost-effectiveness, and optimal \nintegration with lifestyle interventions.\n\nDOI: 10.1530/EC-25-0723\nPMID: 41532579"

As a result, it is increasingly prescribed for patients with \nT2DM who are\u00a0at an elevated risk of adverse cardiorenal outcomes, specifically \nthose with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart \nfailure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD).\u00a0 Objective This study aimed to \nevaluate clinicians' perspectives on the role of empagliflozin in the management \nof T2DM in India, particularly among patients with cardiovascular, renal, and \nmetabolic comorbidities. Methods A structured new age for a virtual advisory \nboard was conducted with overall 625 experts, including endocrinologists, \ndiabetologists, and cardiologists from diverse regions of India. The 16-item \nquestionnaire used in this advisory board was developed by an expert panel based \non published evidence and clinical experience; however, it was not formally \nvalidated or pilot-tested prior to administration. As such, responses may \nreflect expert opinion and clinical judgment rather than performance on a \nstandardized, validated instrument. Results Strong consensus was observed across \nkey domains: 95% agreed that empagliflozin should be a foundational therapy for \nT2DM patients with ASCVD, while 93% supported its use for HF prevention across \nall ejection fractions, and 93% endorsed its role in slowing the progression of \ndiabetic kidney disease. Early initiation in high cardiorenal risk patients, \neven before metformin, was favored by 90%. Additionally, 92% supported its use \nin non-diabetic HF and CKD patients. Notably, 83% of clinicians perceived \nempagliflozin to have a superior clinical profile compared with other SGLT2 \ninhibitors; however, this reflects expert perception rather than direct \ncomparative evidence, and many benefits are recognized as class effects across \nthe SGLT2 inhibitor group. A favorable safety profile was affirmed by 86% of \nexperts, while additional benefits such as metabolic dysfunction-associated \nsteatotic liver disease (MASLD) improvement (86%), quality-of-life enhancement \n(90%), and uric acid reduction (84%) were also acknowledged based on clinical \nexperience and emerging evidence. Conclusion This expert consensus highlights \nwidespread clinical support for empagliflozin as a cornerstone therapy in T2DM, \nespecially for patients with cardiovascular, renal, or metabolic risk. Its \nmultidimensional benefits support early initiation and broad application in \nIndian clinical practice.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025, Sethi et al.\n\nDOI: 10.7759/cureus.99023\nPMCID: PMC12791183\nPMID: 41531619\n\nConflict of interest statement: Human subjects: Informed consent for treatment \nand open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this \nstudy.

Over the past three decades, \nmanagement has evolved from strict glycemic and blood pressure control to \ntargeted therapies that modify disease progression.\nSUMMARY: The DCCT/EDIC (1993) confirmed the impact of intensive glycemic and \nmultifactorial risk factor management. But the early 1990s established the \nfoundation of nephroprotective therapy with the Captopril trial (1993) in type 1 \ndiabetes and subsequent IRMA-1 (2001), IDNT (2001), and the RENAAL (2001) \nstudies established renin-angiotensin-system (RAAS) blockade as the first \ndisease-specific therapy. More than a decade later, sodium-glucose \ncotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors transformed care, with EMPA-REG OUTCOME \n(2015) and CANVAS (2017) studies first demonstrating kidney benefits as \nsecondary outcomes, which were confirmed in subsequent dedicated kidney trials: \nCREDENCE (2019), DAPA-CKD (2020), and EMPA-KIDNEY (2022) studies, demonstrating \nconsistent reductions in kidney failure and cardiovascular mortality. Finerenone \nfurther advanced outcomes in FIDELIO-DKD (2020) and FIGARO-DKD (2021), and \ncombination therapy with SGLT2 inhibition showed additive benefit in the \nCONFIDENCE (2025) study. Most recently, the FLOW (2024) trial confirmed \nglucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) as promising fourth pillar \nof nephroprotective therapies.\nKEY MESSAGES: Together, these advances, termed the \"Fantastic Four\", have \nredefined standards of care in DKD. This review synthesizes pivotal clinical \ntrials and highlights evolving strategies to guide individualized treatment and \nfuture research.\n\nThe Author(s). Published by S.

Recently, novel pharmacological agents, including \nSGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs, and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists, have \ndemonstrated dual benefits in improving glycemic control and reducing body \nweight. These drugs act through distinct but complementary mechanisms-such as \npromoting glycosuria, enhancing satiety, delaying gastric emptying, and \nmodulating energy homeostasis-resulting in significant reductions in BMI and \nvisceral fat. Among these agents, tirzepatide has shown superior efficacy in \nimproving metabolic parameters and body composition compared with single \nreceptor agonists. Understanding the multifaceted metabolic benefits of these \npharmacotherapies is essential for optimizing individualized therapeutic \nstrategies for patients with diabesity. Integrating these agents into \ncomprehensive diabetes care allows clinicians to more effectively target the \ncomplex pathophysiology of diabesity, ultimately improving long-term metabolic \nand clinical outcomes in this growing patient population.\n\n\u00a9 2026.

However, \nwhile current guidelines recommend these drug classes alone, combination therapy \nis not explicitly advocated. Herein we summarise the rationale and available \nevidence in support for combination therapy.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Evidence suggests that combining SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 \nreceptor agonists improves metabolic outcomes, including HbA1c, body weight, and \nblood pressure. More importantly, combination therapy can offer potential \nadvantages for addressing residual cardiovascular risk, particularly in \nhigh-risk populations. Data from cardiovascular outcomes trials and real-world \nstudies demonstrate consistent benefits of combination therapy across diverse \nsubpopulations, including those with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular \ndisease or chronic kidney disease. However, robust evidence remains limited for \nindividuals at low cardiovascular risk, where therapy should primarily focus on \nmetabolic goals. Of note, combination therapy faces significant barriers, \nincluding safety concerns in older or frail individuals, underutilisation in \ndisadvantaged populations, while economic challenges may further hinder the \naccessibility of these therapies. Upfront combination therapy with both SGLT-2 \ninhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists could further reduce cardiovascular risk \nin people with type 2 diabetes, although it is crucial to pare down cost and \ndisparities to access to maximise widespread benefits at population level.\n\n\u00a9 2026.

This systematic review and network \nmeta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of interventions \nconcerning major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), heart failure, and renal \noutcomes. A systematic review and network meta-analysis of large-scale, \nplacebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome trials was conducted. PubMed, Embase, \nand CENTRAL were searched for trials published up to December 2025. The primary \noutcome was MACE (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or \nnonfatal stroke). The secondary outcomes included hospitalization for heart \nfailure (HHF), composite renal outcomes, and all-cause mortality. The evaluated \nsafety outcomes included severe hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, amputation, \nfracture, and genital infections. Data were pooled using a frequentist \nrandom-effects model. In total, 14 trials involving 117,633 participants were \nincluded. Both drug classes reduced the risk of MACE compared with placebo \n(SGLT2i: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.84-0.94; \nGLP-1RA: HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.80-0.93), with no statistically significant \ndifference observed between the two (HR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.94-1.13). SGLT2 \ninhibitors had a greater efficacy than GLP-1 receptor agonists in reducing HHF \n(HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.66-0.85) and composite renal outcomes (HR = 0.76, 95% CI \n= 0.66-0.87). Similarly, both classes lowered all-cause mortality. SGLT2 \ninhibitors exhibited an elevated risk of genital infections (relative risk (RR) \n= 3.49, 95% CI = 2.63-4.55) and diabetic ketoacidosis (RR = 2.36, 95% CI = \n1.33-4.17) compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists. SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 \nreceptor agonists are equally effective in preventing MACE. However, SGLT2 \ninhibitors offer enhanced protection against heart failure and renal disease \nprogression, whereas GLP-1 receptor agonists exhibit a more favorable safety \nprofile for genital infections and ketoacidosis. These findings support a \nphenotype-specific treatment approach for patients with T2DM.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2026, Alqurain et al.\n\nDOI: 10.7759/cureus.100927\nPMCID: PMC12781563\nPMID: 41523725\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflicts of interest: In compliance with the \nICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following: \nPayment/services info: All authors have declared that no financial support was \nreceived from any organization for the submitted work.

However, their safety and efficacy in kidney transplant recipients \nremain uncertain. This study aims to evaluate the impact of GLP-1 RAs on \nall-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and major \nadverse kidney events (MAKE) in adult kidney transplant recipients.\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of retrospective \ncohort studies reporting outcomes in adult kidney transplant recipients treated \nwith GLP-1 RAs. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library \nwas performed up to July 2025. Studies were included if they reported on at \nleast one of the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, MACE, or MAKE. Pooled \nhazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a \nrandom-effects model.\nRESULTS: A total of four retrospective cohort studies involving 27,153 were \nincluded. A total of 5,479 (20.2%) patients received GLP-1 RAs. The median \nfollow-up period across studies ranged from 1.38 to 3.1 years. GLP-1 RAs \ntreatment was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality, \nwith an aHR of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.32-0.85, I\u00b2 = 86%; p\u2009=\u20090.009). Similarly, a \nsignificant reduction in MAKEs was observed, with a pooled aHR of 0.62 (95% CI, \n0.53-0.73; I\u00b2 = 15%; p\u2009<\u20090.00001).\nCONCLUSIONS: In kidney transplant recipients with type 2 DM, GLP-1 RAs appear to \nbe associated with reduced risks of all-cause mortality and MAKEs. However, \ngiven the high heterogeneity across studies and the influence of a single large \ncohort, these findings should be interpreted with caution and considered \nexploratory. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the long-term safety and \nefficacy of GLP-1 RAs in this population.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material \navailable at 10.1007/s40200-025-01801-7.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Tehran University of Medical \nSciences 2026.

However, the association of GLP-1RAs use with \nmortality and morbidity in heart transplant (HT) recipients has not been \npreviously investigated.\nMETHODS: All adult patients who underwent HT at three Mayo Clinic sites and \nsurvived at least one month after the procedure were assessed. GLP-1RAs use was \nextracted retrospectively from the electronic medical records (EMR) after the \nHT. All-cause mortality and hospitalization due to graft dysfunction, graft \nrejection, vasculopathy, de novo DM, and dialysis were collected and compared \nbetween patients exposed and non-exposed to GLP-1RA using Kaplan-Meier curves, \ncumulative incidence functions, and multivariate Cox regression analyses \nincorporating GLP-1RA exposure as a time varying covariate.\nRESULTS: A total of 1914 patients were included with a median age of 56.3 (46.1, \n62.8) years and 71.2% were male. The median follow up was 5.5 (2.2,10.2) years \nand 285 (14.9%) used GLP-1RAs following HT. In the multivariable time-dependent \nCox analysis, GLP-1RA therapy was associated with lower risk of all-cause \nmortality (HR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.90; p = 0.031), but not with \nhospitalization due to graft dysfunction (HR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.45 to 2.01; p = \n0.900) or other outcomes through 5-year follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS: Therapy with GLP-1RAs was associated with a lower risk of all-cause \nmortality in HT recipients. While the mechanisms of these associations need \nfurther investigations, these findings, suggest a potential therapeutic role to \nimprove survival after HT.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation. \nPublished by Elsevier Inc.

While robust evidence supporting their use in kidney \ntransplant recipients (KTRs) remains limited, PTDM remains a major driver of \nadverse outcomes, including cardiovascular morbidity, accelerated graft \ndysfunction, graft loss, and reduced survival. Methods: This retrospective \ncohort study analyzed adult KTRs with PTDM treated with SGLT2is and/or GLP-1 RAs \nbetween 2013 and 2024. Metabolic, kidney, and safety parameters were assessed \nfrom baseline to follow-up. Results: After a median treatment duration of 1.8 \nyears, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) changed from 7.22% to 7.01% (p = 0.558), \nwhereas fasting plasma glucose increased from 112.62 mg/dL to 125.01 mg/dL (p = \n0.03). Body mass index decreased from 27.27 kg/m2 to 25.95 kg/m2 (p < 0.001). \nThe lipid profile improved, with reductions in total cholesterol (p < 0.01) and \nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c, p = 0.02). Kidney function remained \nstable throughout the observation period, and adverse events were infrequent. \nConclusions: In KTRs with PTDM, GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2is were associated with \nsignificant improvements in weight and lipid metabolism, alongside stable kidney \nfunction and a favorable safety profile. These findings support the \nconsideration of these agents in the management of PTDM.

New initiators of semaglutide or dulaglutide \u226518\u2009years with both \nT2D and ASCVD were included. The index date was the first date of a prescription \nclaim for semaglutide or dulaglutide within the index medication identification \nperiod (1 January 2018 through 31 March 2024). The primary outcome was 3-point \nMACE (stroke, myocardial infarction [MI], cardiovascular [CV]-related death). \nEntropy balancing was applied to balance baseline characteristics.

The mean age was 68.2 and 69.3\u2009years (unweighted) in the semaglutide \nand dulaglutide cohorts, respectively. After balancing, standardized mean \ndifferences were <0.1 for all variables. The incidence rates of the primary \noutcome, 3-point MACE, were 25.7 and 33.0 in the semaglutide and dulaglutide \ncohorts, respectively. Compared with the dulaglutide cohort, the semaglutide \ncohort had a 22% lower risk of 3-point MACE (hazard ratio, 0.78 [95% CI, \n0.70-0.87]; p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Among United States Medicare Optum CDM enrolees with T2D and ASCVD, \nsemaglutide was associated with reduced risks of CV outcomes compared with \ndulaglutide.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), approved \nfor diabetes and obesity, have shown promise in modulating reward-related brain \npathways, suggesting potential benefits in the management of AUD.\nMETHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis, registered in PROSPERO and \nconducted per PRISMA guidelines, assessed the effects of GLP-1RA use on AUD and \nalcohol-related outcomes in adults with obesity or type 2 diabetes mellitus. \nFive databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) \nwere searched up to September 30, 2025. Random-effects models were applied, and \nsensitivity analyses examined result stability. No subgroup or meta-regression \nanalyses were performed owing to the small number of eligible studies.\nRESULTS: Five observational cohort studies (three on AUD diagnosis, two on \nalcohol-related hospitalization) were included, with sample sizes ranging from \n4,321 to >\u200953,000 participants. GLP-1RA use was associated with a 28% lower risk \nof AUD diagnosis (HR\u2009=\u20090.72, 95% CI 0.59-0.89; I\u00b2 = 65%). For alcohol-related \nhospitalization, a non-significant reduction was observed (HR\u2009=\u20090.76, 95% CI \n0.57-1.01; I\u00b2 = 77%). Leave-one-out sensitivity analyses confirmed the direction \nand magnitude of the AUD finding but highlighted the limited evidence base for \nhospitalization.\nCONCLUSION: GLP-1RA use was associated with a reduced risk of AUD diagnosis, \nwith a possible but non-significant reduction in alcohol-related \nhospitalization. Effects may be mediated through modulation of mesolimbic reward \npathways and the gut-brain axis. Further large-scale trials are warranted to \nconfirm these findings.\n\n\u00a9 2026.

The complex \npathophysiology and the metabolic risk factors shared between type 2 diabetes, \nobesity, CKD and cardiovascular disease have led to the concept of a \ncardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome. The treatment landscape for CKM \nchanged dramatically when agents from several medication classes, originally \ndeveloped as glucose-lowering therapies, were recognized to reduce the risk of \nmultiple components of CKM syndrome. Incretin-based therapies, including \nglucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and dual glucose-dependent \ninsulinotropic-GLP-1RAs, have evolved from metabolic therapies to agents with \neither proven or potential protective effects on the kidney and heart. In \naddition to their potent metabolic actions that reduce hyperglycaemia and body \nweight, GLP-1RAs also lower the risk of major kidney, cardiovascular and \nmortality outcomes across broad populations with cardiovascular disease or CKD, \nwith and without diabetes or obesity. GLP-1RAs have been combined with \nglucose-dependent insulinotropic agonism, as well as glucagon agonism or amylin \nanalogues to further enhance their metabolic benefits. However, kidney and heart \nprotection are not fully explainable by the metabolic actions of these agents. \nRather, a growing body of evidence suggests that the systemic and local actions \nof incretins and metabolic hormones modulate multiple pathways that can promote \ninflammatory and fibrotic injury.\n\n\u00a9 2026.

This systematic meta-analysis \naimed to investigate sex differences in trial representation and the \ncardiovascular and kidney efficacy of SGLT-2is and GLP-1RAs in patients with and \nwithout type 2 diabetes (T2D).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) were identified \nthrough searches in MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL, and manual search of \nClinicalTrials.gov up to August 2025. Sex-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% \nconfidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. \nSex-differential treatment effects were assessed using the ratio of HRs and \nmeta-regression.\nRESULTS: Across 47 articles from 25 unique CVOTs (n\u2009>\u2009185\u2009000) published between \n2015 and 2025, women were less represented (approximately one-third of trial \nparticipants). SGLT-2is and GLP-1RAs significantly reduced cardio-kidney \noutcomes in both men and women. In individuals with T2D, SGLT-2is significantly \nreduced risks of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 0.87 (0.80-0.95) and \ncomposite cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure 0.73 \n(0.64-0.83) in men, with broadly similar results for women and also for both \nsexes in individuals without T2D. In individuals with T2D, GLP-1RAs reduced MACE \nrisk in men 0.89 (0.82-0.96) and women 0.83 (0.77-0.91). Pooled ratio of HRs \nshowed no significant sex differences, though some cardiovascular benefits \nappeared slightly greater in women; formal interactions were not statistically \nsignificant.\nCONCLUSIONS: SGLT-2is and GLP-1RAs provide broadly comparable cardio-kidney \nbenefits across sexes in patients with and without T2D. The lower representation \nof women in CVOTs warrants attention.\n\n\u00a9 2026 The Author(s).

We evaluated the \nreal-world effectiveness of GLP-1RA therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in \npatients with T2D after myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemic stroke and \nexamined trends and disparities.\nMETHODS: Using nationwide Czech registry data (2015-2024), we identified \npatients with incident nonfatal MI or ischemic stroke and confirmed T2D. GLP-1RA \nusers-initiating therapy within 12 months post-event-were propensity \nscore-matched to non-users. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular \nevents (MACE: nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, cardiovascular death); secondary \noutcomes included individual components and all-cause mortality.\nRESULTS: GLP-1RA therapy was initiated in only \u223c2% of MI and stroke survivors \nwith T2D. Among 126,845 MI survivors, 28,206 had T2D; the matched cohort \ncomprised 2,271 patients (401 GLP-1RA; median follow-up 35 months). GLP-1RA use \nwas associated with lower risk of MACE (HR:0.7; 95%CI:0.52-0.93), all-cause \n(HR:0.61;95%CI:0.47-0.80) and cardiovascular death (HR:0.54, 95%CI:0.36-0.80). \nAmong 177,115 stroke survivors, 73,750 had T2D; the matched cohort comprised \n2,235 patients (385 GLP-1RA; median follow-up 27 months). GLP-1RA use was \nassociated with lower risk of MACE (HR:0.71; 95%CI:0.54-0.94), all-cause \n(HR:0.59;95%CI:0.46-0.76) and cardiovascular death (HR:0.55; 95%CI:0.37-0.81).\nCONCLUSIONS: GLP-1RA therapy after MI or stroke in T2D was associated with \nsubstantially lower risks of MACE, cardiovascular and all-cause death in \nreal-world practice. Utilization remained low, particularly among women and \nolder adults, underscoring the need for broader and more equitable \nimplementation in secondary prevention.\n\nPlain Language Summary: People with type 2 diabetes are at very high risk of \nanother heart attack or stroke after their first event. Some modern diabetes \nmedicines, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, have shown heart-protective \nbenefits in clinical trials, but it has been unclear how well these benefits \ntranslate into everyday clinical care. In this nationwide study from the Czech \nRepublic, we analyzed real-world data from more than 300,000 people who survived \na heart attack or stroke between 2015 and 2024. We found that survivors with \ntype 2 diabetes who started a GLP-1 receptor agonist within the first year after \ntheir event had markedly better outcomes\u2014about a 30% lower risk of another major \ncardiovascular event and a 40\u201345% lower risk of death from any cause or \ncardiovascular causes\u2014compared with similar patients who did not receive these \nmedicines. However, only a small proportion of eligible patients were prescribed \nGLP-1 receptor agonists, and important differences in access persisted by age \nand sex. In summary:Starting a GLP-1 receptor agonist after a heart attack or \nstroke was linked to fewer deaths and cardiovascular events.Despite these \nbenefits, very few eligible patients received these medicines, highlighting the \nneed for better implementation of evidence-based care.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2026.

Traditional therapies such as continuous \npositive airway pressure are effective but often limited by poor adherence. \nRecent evidence suggests that tirzepatide, a dual glucagon like receptor-1 and \nglucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor agonist, may offer a \npharmacologic approach to OSA management through its weight-reducing and \nmetabolic effects. This narrative review was conducted using a structured search \nof PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases for English-language articles \npublished up to May 2024. Keywords included \"tirzepatide\", \"obstructive sleep \napnea\", \"OSA\", and \"GLP-1 agonist\". Clinical trials, systematic reviews, and \nrelevant observational studies focusing on tirzepatide's role in OSA or obesity \nwere included and thematically analyzed. Emerging evidence from the SURMOUNT-OSA \nand related trials indicates that tirzepatide leads to clinically significant \nreductions in body weight, apnea-hypopnea index, and systemic inflammation. The \ndrug was found to be effective and also showed additional benefits in sleep \nquality and cardiovascular risk factors. Tirzepatide represents a promising \npharmacologic advancement in the management of obesity-related OSA.

This narrative review synthesizes evidence from the SURPASS, \nSURMOUNT, and SUMMIT clinical trial programs. Across studies, tirzepatide \nreduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by up to 2.5% and body weight by more than \n20%. It also improved cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, \ninflammation) and has demonstrated benefits in patients with heart failure with \npreserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), with \nreductions in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and heart failure hospitalizations. \nIts safety profile is consistent with that of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 \nRAs), although gastrointestinal side effects, gallbladder events, and thyroid \ncancer signals warrant monitoring.

The patients were divided into five \ngroups based on their medications at 3 months after discharge: defined as a \ncombination of SGLT2i, GLP-1RA, ARNI, and MRA. The primary outcome is major \nadverse cardiovascular (CV) events (MACEs), corresponding to the CV mortality \nand/or HF rehospitalization. The secondary outcome is CV mortality as well as \nleft ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) change or HF category transition.\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 54 (27-75) months, participants \nwith quadruple combination showed the most benefits, corresponding to MACEs \n(79/174; P <0.001), CV mortality (46/174; P = 0.03), LVEF change, or HF \ntransitions.

Beyond glucose-lowering, incretin-based therapies may provide organ \nprotection across the cardiorenal axis.\nMETHODS: Narrative review of mechanistic pathways and randomized trials of GLP-1 \nreceptor agonists (GLP-1RA), DPP-4 inhibitors, and newer dual/triple agonists, \nwith targeted updates from recent pivotal programs (SELECT, FLOW, SOUL, \nSURPASS-CVOT) and emerging oral small-molecule GLP-1R agonists.\nRESULTS: Long-acting GLP-1RA reduces major adverse CV events (MACE), all-cause \nand CV death, heart-failure hospitalization, and kidney composites across CV \noutcome trials and meta-analyses. A 2019 pooled analysis and a 2025 update \nconfirm consistent reductions in MACE and hard kidney outcomes independent of \nbaseline HbA1c. In obesity without diabetes, semaglutide 2.4\u00a0mg lowered MACE in \nSELECT, expanding prevention beyond glycemia. In CKD with T2DM, FLOW showed that \nsemaglutide reduced major kidney disease events and death from CV/kidney causes. \nIn T2DM with ASCVD and/or CKD, the SOUL cardiovascular outcome trial (CVOT) \ndemonstrated that oral semaglutide reduced three-point MACE versus placebo. In \nhead-to-head CVOT, tirzepatide was non-inferior to dulaglutide on MACE while \nachieving greater weight and HbA1c reductions. Mechanistically, GLP-1R signaling \nspans Gs-cAMP/PKA, \u03b2-arrestin-dependent pathways, and additional routes \n(including Gq contexts), aligning with anti-inflammatory, natriuretic, and \nantifibrotic effects observed preclinically and clinically. Oral non-peptide \nGLP-1R agonists (e.g., orforglipron) show phase 2 efficacy but lack long-term \nCV/renal outcome data.\nCONCLUSIONS: Incretin-based therapy has shifted care from glucose-centric \ntargets to cardiorenal risk reduction. GLP-1RA are guideline-endorsed for \npatients with T2DM and high CV/renal risk irrespective of HbA1c; dual agonists \nand oral small-molecule agents may broaden indications pending definitive \noutcome evidence.\n\n\u00a9 2026.

Preclinical \nstudies have demonstrated that GLP-1 RA inhibit progression of solid tumor \nmalignancies via downregulation of cellular proliferation pathways and improved \nglycemic control. Despite these promising findings, studies characterizing the \neffects of GLP-1 RA in patients with active cancer are limited.\nMETHODS: Using TriNetX, a global database comprising over 120 million patients, \nwe identified an overall cohort of 3747 patients with type 2 diabetes who \nreceived GLP-1 RA within 3 months of starting systemic therapy and identified \n52,061 patients receiving metformin in the same timeframe as a control cohort. \nAdditional sub-analyses stratified patients by hemoglobin A1c range, obesity, \nand by participants \"newly started\" on their first instance of GLP-1 RA within 3 \nmonths of starting cancer treatment.\nRESULTS: Patients receiving GLP-1 RA had significantly reduced mortality in both \nthe overall monotherapy setting (HR: 0.875, 95% CI: (0.778-0.985), p=0.0268) and \nthe new start setting (HR: 0.786 , 95% CI: (0.662-0.934), p= 0.0062) cohorts. \nSecondary analyses found lower rates of all-cause hospitalization, sepsis, major \nadverse cardiovascular events, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia in patients on \nGLP-1 RA. Sub-analyses stratified by BMI and A1c did not meet statistical \nsignificance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetes and cancer who received GLP-1 RA experienced \nsuperior survival outcomes and reduced rates of hospitalization compared to \npatients receiving metformin. Additionally, patients already on metformin and \nnewly started on GLP-1 RA demonstrated superior survival outcomes compared to \npatients newly started on insulin. Further prospective, well-controlled studies \nare needed to evaluate the benefits of GLP-1 RA in patients with diabetes and \ncancer.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2026.

Ongoing clinical trials are further investigating their potential \nbeneficial effects on multiple cardiovascular conditions. Even though the \nunderlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood, it is speculated that their \ncardiovascular protection goes beyond simply lowering plasma glucose levels. By \nreducing chronic inflammation through multiple pathways, these therapeutic \nagents seem to have pleiotropic effects on the cardiovascular system. This \ndescriptive review summarizes the most important anti-inflammatory pathways of \nSGLT2 is and GLP1-RAs, as described in present literature. We focus on \ninflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, immune cell and mitochondrial function \nmodulation, inflammatory pathway regulation and endothelial dysfunction \nimprovement, with particular emphasis on their role in cardiovascular \nprotection.
